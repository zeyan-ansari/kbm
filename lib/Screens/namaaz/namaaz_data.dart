    """Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) has reported that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said to Imam Ali (a.s.), "O Ali! I shall give you some moralities that you should observe... Abide by the night prayer. Abide by the night prayer. Abide by the night prayer. Abide by the midday prayer. Abide by the midday prayer. Abide by the midday prayer."

It is apparently understood from this tradition that the night prayer stands for the thirteen units of prayer while the midday prayer is the eight units of the supererogatory noon prayer.

Anas ibn Malik has reported that he heard the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) saying, "To offer two units of prayer in the midst of night is more favorable to me than possessing this world and whatever therein."

When he was asked why those who practice the night worship had shining faces, Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abidin (a.s.) answered, "As they withdrew themselves with their Lord, He granted them of His Light."

In conclusion, traditions about the merits of offering the night prayer are very numerous. It is thus discommended to avoid the night acts of worship.

Shaykh has reported through an authentic chain of authority that Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) said, "All servants (of Allah) wake up once, twice, or even more times at night. If a servant does not go for the night worship, Satan will open his legs and urinate in his ear. This is why those who do not do the night worship wake up in the morning heavy and lazy."

Al-Barqi has reported through a valid chain of authority that Imam al-Baqir (a.s.) said, "There is a devil called al-Raha appointed for the night. When a servant (of Allah) intends to get up for the night prayer, this devil inspires to him that the time of prayer has not yet come. When the servant tries to get up again, the devil repeats the same evil inspiration and prevents the servant from offering the prayer until the day dawns. When it dawns, the devil urinates in the ear of that servant and goes back moving its tail in joy."

Ibn Abi-Jumhur reported the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) as saying to his companions, "When you go to sleep, Satan ties three knots at your head. Each knot inspires to you that the night is still long; therefore, you would better sleep. When you wake up and mention Almighty Allah, one knot is untied. When you do the ritual ablution, another knot is untied. When you perform the prayer, the third knot is untied. Hence, you will find yourselves active and positive in the morning; lest, you find yourselves inactive and frowning."

This tradition is reported in Sunni books of hadith, too.

Al-Qutb al-Rawandi reported Imam Ali Ameer al-Momineen (a.s.) as saying, "Do not expect three matters as long as you have been engaged in three: Do not expect ability to do night worship as long as you overeat. Do not expect bright-facedness as long as you spend the whole night sleeping. Do not expect security in your life as long as you accompany sinful people."

Al-Qutb al-Rawandi has also reported that Prophet Jesus (a.s.) called his mother (a.s.) after her death and asked, "Mother, do you wish to return to life?" His mother answered, "Yes, I do, so that I will offer prayers to Almighty Allah in the midst of night and observe fasting in the extremely hot days. O son, this path is horrifying."

THE NIGHT PRAYER

The time of the Night Prayer begins after midnight; yet, it is recommended to perform it as near as possible to dawn.

The Night Prayer consists of eight units of prayer; each two alone. Taslim should be said at the end of each two units with the intention of offering the Night Prayer. It is advisable to recite Surah Ikhlas after Surah al-Faatehah in 1st rakaat at least once and at most thirty times (if there is time). In the 2nd rakaat recite Surah al-Kafirun after Surah al-Faatehah.

In the other six units of the prayer, one may recite any Surah he chooses. However, it is sufficiently acceptable to recite Surah al-Faatehah and Surah Ikhlas in each unit of the Night Prayer. It is also permissible to recite Surah al-Faatehah alone.

NAMAZ E SHAFA

When you accomplish the eight-unit Night Prayer, you may then offer the two-unit Shafa Prayer. It has two rakats. Recite it after finish Namaz e tahajjud. In the first rakat, after Surah Fatehah recite Surah al-Ikhlas or Surah al-Falaq. In the second rakat, recite only Surah Fatehah and Surah al-Nas and finish the namaz. Qunoot is not recited in this namaz. After finishing the namaz, recite Tasbeeh e Janab e Fatima (s.a.) and supplicate to Allah. The supplication will be surely granted for this is the right time for the grants of prayers. Then after performing Sajdah e Shukr recite Namaz e Witr.

NAMAZ E WITR

This namaz has one rakat. In this prayer recite Surah Fatehah then Surah al-Ikhlas, Surah al-Falaq, Surah al-Nas three times each. Then raise your hands and recite the following Qunoot.

لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ الْحَلِيْمُ الْكَرِيْمُ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللّٰهُ الْعَلِىُّ الْعَظِيْمُ سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ رَبِّ السَّمٰوَاتِ السَّبْعِ وَ رَبِّ الْاَرَضِيْنَ السَّبْعِ وَ مَا فِيْهِنَّ وَ مَا بَيْنَهُنَّ وَ مَا فَوْقَهُنَّ وَ مَا تَحْتَهُنَّ وَ هُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيْمِ وَ سَلَامٌ عَلَي الْمُرْسَلِيْنَ وَالْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِيْنَ يَا اَللهُ الَّذِيْ لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ وَ هُوَ السَّمِيْعُ الْبَصِيْرُ وَصَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ۔

It is also recommended, during Qunut, to weep, or even try to weep, out of fear of Almighty Allah and fear of His chastisement. It is also desirable to pray Almighty Allah for the good of one's brethren-in-faith, whether dead or alive, in the following words:

اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِهٰذَا۔۔۔۔۔

It is also highly advisable to repeat the following imploration seventy times and, meanwhile, raise the left hand for supplicating and count with the right hand:

اَسْتَغْفِرُاللهَ رَبِّىْ وَ اَتُوْبُ اِلَيْهِ۔

It is also narrated that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to implore for Almighty Allah's forgiveness seventy times during the Witr Prayer and then say the following statement:

هٰذَا مَقامُ الْعَاۤئِذِ بِكَ مِنَ النَّارِ۔

It is also narrated that Imam Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abidin (a.s.) used to repeat the following word three hundred times during the Witr Prayer:

اَلْعَفْوَ اَلْعَفْوَ۔

After that, the Imam (a.s.) would say the following supplicatory prayer:

رَبِّ اغْفِرْلِىْ وَارْحَمْنِىْ وَ تُبْ عَلىَّ اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ التَّوَّابُ الْغَفُوْرُ الرَّحِيْمُ۔

You may then prostrate yourself and accomplish the prayer. After the accomplishment, you may say Tasbih al-Zahra'. After that, you may say the following:

اَلْحَمْدُ لِرَبِّ الصَّبَاحِ الْحَمْدُ لِفَالِقِ الْاِصْبَاحِ۔

It is also highly advisable to say the following supplicatory prayer, which is called Dua e Hazeen (The Supplication of the Sad).

اُنَاجِیْكَ یَا مَوْجُوْدً فِی كُلِّ مَكَانٍ لَعَلَّكَ تَسْمَعُ نِدَاۤئِی فَقَدْ عَظُمَ جُرْمِیْ وَ قَلَّ حَیَاۤئِی یَا مَوْلَایَ اَیَّ الْاَهْوَالِ اَتَذَكَّرُ وَ اَیَّهَا اَنْسٰی وَ لَوْ لَمْ یَكُنْ اِلَّا الْمَوْتُ لَكَفٰی كَیْفَ وَ مَا بَعْدَ الْمَوْتِ اَعْظَمُ وَ اَدْهٰی مَوْلَایَ یَا مَوْلَایَ حَتّٰی مَتٰی وَ اِلٰی مَتٰی اَقُوْلُ لَكَ الْعُتْبٰی مَرَّةً بَعْدَ اُخْرٰی ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُ عِنْدِیْ صِدْقًا وَ لَا وَفَاۤءً فَیَا غَوْثَاهُ ثُمَّ وَا غَوْثَاهُ بِكَ یَاۤ اَللهُ مِنْ هَوًی قَدْ غَلَبَنِیْ وَ مِنْ عَدُوٍّ قَدِ اسْتَكْلَبَ عَلَیَّ وَ مِنْ دُنْیَا قَدْ تَزَیَّنَتْ لِیْ وَ مِنْ نَفْسِ اَمَّارَةٍ بِالسُّوْۤءِ اِلَّا مَا رَحِمَ رَبِّیْ مَوْلَایَ یَا مَوْلَایَ اِنْ كُنْتَ رَحِمْتَ مِثْلِیْ فَارْحَمْنِیْ وَ اِنْ كُنْتَ قَبِلْتَ مِثْلِیْ فَاقْبَلْنِیْ یَا قَابِلَ السَّحَرَةِ اقْبَلْنِیْ یَا مَنْ لَمْ اَزَلْ اَتَعَرَّفُ مِنْهُ الْحُسْنٰی یَا مَنْ یُغَذِّیْنِیْ بِالنِّعَمِ صَبَاحًا وَ مَسَاۤءً اِرْحَمْنِیْ یَوْمَ اٰتِیْكَ فَرْدًا شَاخِصًا اِلَیْكَ بَصَرِیْ مُقَلَّدًا عَمَلِیْ قَدْ تَبَرَّاَ جَمِیْعُ الْخَلْقِ مِنِّیْ نَعَمْ وَ اَبِیْ وَ اُمِّیْ وَ مَنْ كَانَ لَهُ كَدِّیْ وَ سَعْیِیْ فَاِنْ لَمْ تَرْحَمْنِیْ فَمَنْ یَرْحَمُنِیْ وَ مَنْ یُؤْنِسُ فِی الْقَبْرِ وَحْشَتِیْ وَ مَنْ یُنْطِقُ لِسَانِیْ اِذَا خَلَوْتُ بِعَمَلِیْ وَ سَاَلْتَنِیْ عَمَّاۤ اَنْتَ اَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنِّیْ فَاِنْ قُلْتُ نَعَمْ فَاَیْنَ الْمَهْرَبُ مِنْ عَدْلِكَ وَ اِنْ قُلْتُ لَمْ اَفْعَلْ قُلْتَ اَ لَمْ اَكُنِ الشَّاهِدَ عَلَیْكَ فَعَفْوُكَ عَفْوُكَ یَا مَوْلَایَ قَبْلَ سَرَابِیْلِ الْقَطِرَانِ عَفْوُكَ عَفْوُكَ یَا مَوْلَایَ قَبْلَ جَهَنَّمَ وَ النِّیْرَانِ عَفْوُكَ عَفْوُكَ یَا مَوْلَایَ قَبْلَ اَنْ تُغَلَّ الْاَیْدِیْ اِلَی الْاَعْنَاقِ یَاۤ اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِیْنَ وَ خَیْرَ الْغَافِرِیْنَ۔

    """The Holy Infallibles (a.s.) are reported to have said innumerable words about the merits of offering the Night Prayer; they have therefore described it as the honor of the true faithful believers. It brings about good health, erases the sins committed in days, saves from the loneliness in graves, beautifies the face, perfumes the body smell, and produces sustenance. Wealth and sons are the ornament of this worldly life, and to offer eight units of prayer at the last hours of night, in addition to a one-unit prayer, is the ornament of the Hereafter. These two ornaments may be granted together by Almighty Allah to some people. Other traditions have it that one who claims that he offers prayers regularly at night and still he suffers hunger is liar, because the night prayer guarantees the sustenance of the next day.

Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) has reported that the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said to Imam Ali (a.s.), "O Ali! I shall give you some moralities that you should observe... Abide by the night prayer.

    """Namaz-e-Ayaat becomes obligatory due the following four things:

1. Solar Eclipse

2. Lunar Eclipse

3. The prayer becomes Wajib even if the moon or the sun are partially eclipsed, and even if they do not engender any fear.

4. Earthquake, as an obligatory precaution, even if no one is frightened. Thunder and lightning, red and black cyclone and other similar celestial phenomena, which frightens most of the people; similarly for the terrestrial events like receding sea water, or falling mountains which engender fear in these circumstances, as per recommended precaution, Namaz-e-Ayaat be offered.

METHOD:

Islamic Law No. 1516. Namaz-e-Ayaat consists of two Rak'ats, and there are five Ruku in each. Its method is as follows: After making niyyat of offering the prayers, one should say takbir (Allahu Akbar) and recite Surah al-Hamd and the other Surah, and then perform the Ruku. Thereafter, he should stand and recite Surah al-Hamd and a Surah and then perform another Ruku. He should repeat this action five times, and, when he stands after the fifth Ruku, he should perform two Sajdah, and then stand up to perform the second Rak'at in the same manner as he has done in the first. Then he should recite tashahhud and Salam.

Islamic Law No. 1517. Namaz-e-Ayaat can also be offered in the following manner:

After making niyyat to offer Namaz-e-Ayaat, a person is allowed to say takbir and recite Surah al-Hamd and then divide the verses of the other Surah into five parts, and recite one verse or more or less, and thereafter perform the Ruku. He should then stand up and recite another part of the Surah (without reciting Surah al-Hamd) and then perform another Ruku. He should repeat this action, and finish that Surah before performing the fifth Ruku. For example, he may say: Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim with the niyyat of reciting Surah al-Ikhlas, and perform the Ruku. He should then stand up and say, Qul huwallahu Ahad, and perform another Ruku. He should then stand up and say, Allahus Samad, and perform the third Ruku. Thereafter he should stand up again and say, Lam yalid walam yulad, and perform the fourth Ruku. Then he should stand up again and say, Walam yakullahu Kufuwan ahad, and then perform two Sajdah and then rise for the second Rak'at, the same way as the first Rak'at. At the end, he should recite tashahhud and Salam after the two Sajdah. It is also permissible to divide a Surah into less than five parts. In that event, however, it is necessary that when the Surah is over, one should recite Surah al-Hamd before the next Ruku.""",

    """It is traditional that the performer of the Deceased Prayer should stand in the middle of the dead body of a man and in front of the breast of the dead body of a woman. This is the most familiar rule. Besides, the performer of the Deceased Prayer should take off the shoes and must intend performing the Deceased Prayer. He must then repeat the takbir statement five times. It is also traditional that he raises his hands to the level of his ears while uttering these statements. Familiarly, he should say the following words after uttering the first takbir statement:

اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَّاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَّسُوْلُ اللهِ۔

These words should be advisably said after uttering the second takbir statement:

اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ۔

These words should be advisably said after uttering the third takbir statement:

اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِلْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ وَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتِ۔

These words should be advisably said after uttering the fourth takbir statement:

اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِهٰذَا الْمَيِّتِ۔

Then, the fifth takbir statement should be uttered, and thus the prayer has been accomplished utterly and acceptably.

As another method, it is familiarly better to say these words immediately after determining the intention of performing the Deceased Prayer:

اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لَّاۤ اِلٰهَ اِللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ لَاشَرِيْكَ لَهُ وَ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَ رَسُوْلُهُ اَرْسَلَهُ بِالْحَقِّ بَشِيْرًا وَّ نَذِيْرًا بَيْنَ يَدَىِ السَّاعَةِ۔

After that, it is recommended to say these words:

اَللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ بَارِكْ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّارْحَمْ مُحَمَّدًا وَّ اٰلَ مُحَمَّدٍ كَاَفْضَلِ مَا صَلَّيْتَ وَ بَارَكْتَ وَ تَرَحَّمْتَ عَلٰى اِبْرَهِيْمَ وَ اٰلِ اِبْرَهيْمَ اِنَّكَ حَمِيْدٌ مَّجِيْدٌ وَ صَلِّ عَلٰى جَمِيْعِ الْاَنْبِيَاۤءِ وَالْمُرْسَلِيْنَ۔

After that, it is recommended to say these words:

اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِلْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ وَالْمُسْلِميْنَ وَالْمُسْلِمَاتِ اَلْاَحْيَاۤءِ مِنْهُمْ وَالْاَمْوَاتِ تَابِعْ بَيْنَنَا وَ بَيْنَهُمْ بِالْخَيْرَاتِ اِنَّكَ مُجِيْبُ الدَّعَوَاتِ اِنَّكَ عَلٰى كُلِّشَيْئٍ قَدِيْرٌ۔

After that, it is recommended to say these words:

اَللّٰهُ اَكْبَرُ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّ هٰذَا عَبْدُكَ وَابْنُ عَبْدِكَ وَابْنُ اَمَتِكَ نَزَلَ بِكَ وَ اَنْتَ خَيْرُ مَنْزُوْلٍ بِهِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّا لَا نَعْلَمُ مِنْهُ اِلَّا خَيْرًا وَ اَنْتَ اَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنَّا اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنْ كَانَ مُحْسِنًا فَزِدْ فِىْ اِحْسَانِهِ وَ اِنْ كَانَ مُسِيْئًا فَتَجَاوَزْ عَنْهُ وَاغْفِرْ لَهُ اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ عِنْدَكَ فِىْ اَعْلٰی عِلِّيِّيْنَ وَاخْلُفْ عَلٰى اَهْلِهِ فِى الْغَابِرِيْنَ وَارْحَمْهُ بِرَحْمَتِكَ يَا اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ۔

The performer of the Deceased Prayer should then say one more takbir statement and finish the prayer.

If the dead person is female, the following words should be said by the performer of the Deceased Prayer instead:

اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّ هٰذِہِ اَمَتُكَ وَابْنَۃُ عَبْدِكَ وَابْنَۃُ اَمَتِكَ نَزَلْتَ بِكَ وَ اَنْتَ خَيْرُ مَنْزُوْلٍ بِهِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّا لَا نَعْلَمُ مِنْهَا اِلَّا خَيْرًا وَ اَنْتَ اَعْلَمُ بِهَا مِنَّا اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنْ كَانَتْ مُحْسِنَۃً فَزِدْ فِىْ اِحْسَانِهَا وَ اِنْ كَانَتْ مُسِيْئَۃً فَتَجَاوَزْ عَنْهَا وَاغْفِرْ لَهَا اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهَا عِنْدَكَ فِىْ اَعْلٰی عِلِّيِّيْنَ وَاخْلُفْ عَلٰى اَهْلِهَا فِى الْغَابِرِيْنَ وَارْحَمْهَا بِرَحْمَتِكَ يَا اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ۔

If the dead person is of those whom are deemed enfeebled, then the performer of the Deceased Prayer should say these words:

اَللّٰهُمَّ اغْفِرْ لِلَّذِيْنَ تَابُوْا وَ اتَّبَعُوْا سَبِيْلَكَ وَ قِهِمْ عَذَابَ الْجَحِيْمِ۔

If the dead person is an immature child, the performer of the Deceased Prayer should say these words:

Altogether with its great merits the most important of which is that it erases major sins, this prayer has been reported through authenticated chain of authority. The best time of its performance is the first hours of daylight on Fridays. It consists of four units with two Tashahhuds (i.e. the part of prayers in which the two creeds of Islam are recited) and two Taslims. In the first unit, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Zalzalah are recited, in the second, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-’Adiyat, in the third, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Nasr, and in the fourth, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Tawheed. In each unit, after the recitation of the Surahs and before the genuflection (ruku'), the following litany (Tasbihat) should be repeated fifteen times:

سُبْحَانَ اللّٰهِ وَ الْحَمْدُ لِلّٰهِ وَ لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اللهُ وَ اللهُ اَكْبَرُ۔

The same litany (Tasbihat) is repeated, yet ten times only, during the Ruku’, after the Ruku’ while standing erect, during the prostration (Sujud), after the first Sajdah, during the second Sajdah, and after the second Sajdah. The same thing is repeated in all of the four units of the prayer. Hence, the litany will have been repeated three hundred times.

Shaykh al-Kulayni has narrated that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) said to Abu-Sa’id al-Mada’ini, “May I teach you something that you should recite in Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer?” As the man answered in the affirmative, the Imam (a.s.) said: After you say the Tasbihat in the second Sajdah of the fourth unit, say the following litany:

سُبْحَانَ مَنْ لَبِسَ الْعِزَّ وَ الْوَقَارَ سُبْحَانَ مَنْ تَعَطَّفَ بِالْمَجْدِ وَ تَكَرَّمَ بِهِ سُبْحَانَ مَنْ لَا يَنْبَغِيْ التَّسْبِيْحُ اِلَّا لَهُ سُبْحَانَ مَنْ اَحْصٰى كُلَّ شَيْ‏ءٍ عِلْمُهُ سُبْحَانَ ذِي الْمَنِّ وَ النِّعَمِ سُبْحَانَ ذِي الْقُدْرَةِ وَ الْكَرَمِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّي اَسْاَلُكَ بِمَعَاقِدِ الْعِزِّ مِنْ عَرْشِكَ وَ مُنْتَهَى الرَّحْمَةِ مِنْ كِتَابِكَ وَ اسْمِكَ الْاَعْظَمِ وَ كَلِمَاتِكَ التَّآمَّةِ الَّتِي تَمَّتْ صِدْقًا وَ عَدْلًا صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ اَهْلِ بَيْتِهِ وَ افْعَلْ بِيْ كَذَا وَ كَذَا۔

Then, you may mention your needs in the form of supplication.

Shaykh al-Tusi and Sayyid Ibn Tawus both narrated that al-Mufaddal ibn ‘Umar said that he heard Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) saying the following supplicatory prayer after accomplishing Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer:

«يَا رَبِّ يَا رَبِّ»

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

«يَا رَبَّاهُ يَا رَبَّاهُ»

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

«رَبِّ رَبِّ»

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

«يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ»

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

«يَا حَىُّ يَا حَىُّ»

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

«يَا رَحِيْمُ يَا رَحِيْمُ»

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

«يَا رَحْمٰنُ يَا رَحْمٰنُ»

Repeat it seven times.

«يَا اَرْحَمَ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ»

Repeat it seven times.

Then, say the following:

اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنِّيْ اَفْتَتِحُ الْقَوْلَ بِحَمْدِكَ وَ اَنْطِقُ بِالثَّنَاۤءِ عَلَيْكَ وَ اُمَجِّدُكَ وَ لَا غَايَةَ لِمَدْحِكَ وَ اُثْنِيْ عَلَيْكَ وَ مَنْ يَبْلُغُ غَايَةَ ثَنَاۤئِكَ وَ اَمَدَ مَجْدِكَ وَ اَنَّى لِخَلِيْقَتِكَ كُنْهُ مَعْرِفَةِ مَجْدِكَ وَ اَيَّ زَمَنٍ لَمْ تَكُنْ مَمْدُوْحًا بِفَضْلِكَ مَوْصُوْفًا بِمَجْدِكَ عَوَّادًا عَلَى الْمُذْنِبِيْنَ بِحِلْمِكَ تَخَلَّفَ سُكَّانُ اَرْضِكَ عَنْ طَاعَتِكَ فَكُنْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ عَطُوْفًا بِجُوْدِكَ جَوَادًا بِفَضْلِكَ عَوَّادًا بِكَرَمِكَ يَا لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّا اَنْتَ الْمَنَّانُ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَ الْاِكْرَامِ۔

Al-Mufaddal then added: Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq(a.s.) then said to me, “If you have a significant request and you want it to be granted, you may offer this prayer, say this supplication, and implore Almighty Allah to respond to you. If you do, it will be granted, Allah willing.”

Shaykh al-Tusi has narrated that Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) recommended the following supplicatory prayer for having one’s requests granted:

Observe fasting on consecutive Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. At Thursday evening, give half bushel of food for ten poor people as alms. On Friday, wash yourself and go out to a wasteland and offer therein Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer sticking your knees to the ground after you uncover them. You may then say the following supplicatory prayer:

يَا مَنْ اَظْهَرَ الْجَمِيْلَ وَ سَتَرَ [عَلَيَ‏] الْقَبِيْحَ يَا مَنْ لَمْ يُؤَاخِذْ بِالْجَرِيْرَةِ وَ لَمْ يَهْتِكِ السِّتْرَ يَا عَظِيْمَ الْعَفْوِ يَا حَسَنَ التَّجَاوُزِ يَا وَاسِعَ الْمَغْفِرَةِ يَا بَاسِطَ الْيَدَيْنِ بِالرَّحْمَةِ يَا صَاحِبَ كُلِّ نَجْوٰى وَ مُنْتَهٰى كُلِّ شَكْوٰى يَا مُقِيْلَ الْعَثَرَاتِ يَا كَرِيْمَ الصَّفْحِ يَا عَظِيْمَ الْمَنِّ يَا مُبْتَدِئًا بِالنِّعَمِ قَبْلَ اسْتِحْقَاقِهَا يَا رَبَّاهُ يَا رَبَّاهُ يَا رَبَّاهُ،

Repeat this statement ten times.

«يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ يَا اَللهُ‏»

Repeat it ten times, too.

«يَا سَیِّدَاهُ يَا سَيِّدَاهُ»

Repeat it ten times.

«يَا مَوْلَايَاهُ،يَا مَوْلَايَاهُ»

Repeat it ten times.

«يَا رَجَاۤءَاهُ»

Repeat it ten times.

«يَا غِيَاثَاهُ»

Repeat it ten times.

«يَا غَايَةَ رَغَبَتَاهُ»

Repeat it ten times.

«يَا رَحْمٰنُ»

Repeat it ten times.

«يَا رَحِيْمُ»

Repeat it ten times.

«يَا مُعْطِىَ الْخَيْرَاتِ»

Shaykh al-Kulayni has narrated that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said to Abu-Sa’id al-Mada’ini, “May I teach you something that you should recite in Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer?” As the man answered in the affirmative, the Imam (a.s.) said: After you say the Tasbihat in the second Sajdah of the fourth unit, say the following litany:

Glory be to Him Who has dressed Himself dignity and sobriety! Glory be to Him Who has deigned and condescended with grandeur! Glory be to Him save Whom none is worthy of being glorified! Glory be to Him Whose knowledge has counted all things! Glory be to the Lord of bounty and boon! Glory be to the Lord of omnipotence and nobility! O Allah, I beseech You in the name of the objects of dignity in Your Throne, •in the name of the utmost of mercy in Your Book, and in the name of Your Greatest Name and Your Accomplished Words, which have been accomplished truly and justly, (please) send blessings to Muhammad and his Household...

Then, you may mention your needs in the form of supplication.

Shaykh al-Tusi and Sayyid Ibn Tawus both narrated that al-Mufaddal ibn ‘Umar said that he heard Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) saying the following supplicatory prayer after accomplishing Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer:

O Lord, O Lord!

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

O my Lord, O my Lord!

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

Lord, Lord!

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

O Allah, O Allah

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

O Ever-living, O Ever- living!

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

O All-merciful, O All- merciful!

Say it as many times as possible in one breath.

O All-compassionate, O All-compassionate!

Repeat it seven times.

O Most Merciful of all those who show mercy!

Repeat it seven times.

Then, say the following:

O Allah, I commence my wording with declaring praise to You, I utter the words of tribute to You, I glorify You although Your glory is limitless, and I compliment You although none can ever compliment You as much as You deserve and none can ever attain the extent of Your glory! And how can Your creatures ever recognize Your glory [in its actual measure]! And how can there be any moment for which You do not deserve praise due to Your favors and in which You are not ascribed to glory and in which You do not incessantly treat the sinful with Your forbearance? Although the inhabitants of Your earth have fallen behind in being obedient to You, You have been kind to them out of Your munificence, munificent out of Your favors, and liberal out of Your generosity. O He save Whom there is no god! O All- benevolent! O Lord of Glory and Honor!

Al-Mufaddal then added: Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) then said to me, “If you have a significant request and you want it to be granted, you may offer this prayer, say this supplication, and implore Almighty Allah to respond to you. If you do, it will be granted, Allah willing.”

Shaykh al-Tusi has narrated that Imam al-Sadiq (a.s.) recommended the following supplicatory prayer for having one’s requests granted:

Observe fasting on consecutive Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. At Thursday evening, give half bushel of food for ten poor people as alms. On Friday, wash yourself and go out to a wasteland and offer therein Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer sticking your knees to the ground after you uncover them. You may then say the following supplicatory prayer:

O He Who has shown only goodness and concealed the evil (deeds of His servants)! O He Who has not censured for the offenses and has not exposed the hidden! O He Who is Ample in pardoning! O He Who is Excellent in overlooking! O He Who is Liberal in forgiveness! O He Who opens His Hands wide with mercy! O He Who is present in all confidential talks! O He Who is the ultimate objective of all complaints! O He Who raises from falls! O He Who is Generous in condonation! O He Who is Great in conferring bounties! O He Who takes the initiative in favoring before they are deserved! O my Lord, O my Lord, O my Lord!

Repeat this statement ten times.

O Allah, O Allah, O Allah!

Repeat it ten times, too.

O my Master, O my Master!

Repeat it ten times.

O my Chief, O my Chief!

Repeat it ten times.

O my hope!

Repeat it ten times.

O my succor!

Repeat it ten times.

O ultimate of my desire!

Repeat it ten times.

O All-beneficent!

Repeat it ten times.

O All-merciful!

Repeat it ten times.

O Giver of fortunes!

Repeat it ten times.

Bless Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad as much as and as decently as You have ever blessed any of Your creatures.

You may then mention your requests.

Many narrations have mentioned emphatically fasting on these three days and then performance of a two-unit prayer at midday on Friday so that one’s requests are granted.""",

Ja’far al-Tayyar’s Prayer is as precious as gold, since it is the most magnificent recommended devotional rite. Altogether with its great merits the most important of which is that it erases major sins, this prayer has been reported through authenticated chain of authority. The best time of its performance is the first hours of daylight on Fridays. It consists of four units with two Tashahhuds (i.e. the part of prayers in which the two creeds of Islam are recited) and two Taslims. In the first unit, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Zalzalah are recited, in the second, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-’Adiyat, in the third, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Nasr, and in the fourth, Surahs al-Faatehah and al-Tawheed. In each unit, after the recitation of the Surahs and before the genuflection (Ruku’), the following litany (Tasbihat) should be repeated fifteen times:

SUBHAANAL LAAHE WAL HAMDO LILLAAHE WA LAA ELAAHA ILLAL LAAHO WALLAAHO AKBARO.

The same litany (Tasbihat) is repeated, yet ten times only, during the Ruku’, after the Ruku’ while standing erect, during the prostration (Sujud), after the first Sajdah, during the second Sajdah, and after the second Sajdah. The same thing is repeated in all of the four units of the prayer. Hence, the litany will have been repeated three hundred times.

After the recitation of these Surahs, say the Takbir statement (i.e. Allahu-akbar) five times and raise your hands for Qunut after each Takbir, saying:

You may then say the Takbir statement for the sixth time, do the genuflection (ruku'), and prostrate yourself (sujud). When you stand up for the second unit, recite Surah al-Faatehah and Surah al-Shams and then say the Takbir statement four times only raising the hands for Qunut after each statement. After that, say the fifth Takbir statement and continue the prayer. After accomplishment of the prayer, say the famous Tasbih al-Zahra’(a.s.).

Narrations have mentioned many supplicatory prayers to be said after the ‘Id Prayer; rather, the best of them may be the 46th supplication of al-Sahifah al-Kamilah al-Sajjadiyyah

It is also recommended to offer the ‘Id Prayer outdoors, directly on the ground without putting a carpet or any other thing under the feet, to return from a way other than the one taken in the coming, and to pray Almighty Allah for accepting the acts of one’s brethren-in-faith.""",

The Imam (a.s.) then added: One who offers this prayer and says this supplication will have all his sins forgiven.

Numerous are the narrations that have mentioned splendid reward for those who offer this prayer on Fridays. Similarly, one who says the following supplicatory prayer after that prayer will have all his previous and coming sins forgiven, will be given the reward of him who recites the holy Qur’an entirely twelve times, and will be saved from thirst on the Resurrection Day:

اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ الْعَرَبِيِّ وَ اٰلِهِ۔""",
    "translation":
    """Shaykh al-Tusi and Sayyid Ibn Tawus have recorded that Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq (a.s.) said: One who offers the four-unit prayer of Imam Ali Ameer al-Momineen (a.s.) will be as free of sins as newborns and will have all his requests granted. In the first unit, recite Surah al-Faatehah (No. 1) once and repeat Surah al-Tawheed (No. 112) fifty times. On accomplishment, say the following litany of Imam Ali, peace be upon him:

Glory be to Him Whose signs never perish. Glory be to Him Whose reserves never downgrade. Glory be to Him Whose honor never vanishes. Glory be to Him Whose possessions never run out. Glory be to Him Whose duration (of existence) is never interrupted. Glory be to Him Who never betakes to Himself a partner in His affairs. Glory be to Him save Whom there is no god.

Thereafter, say the following supplicatory prayer:

O He who overlooks sins and does not inflict punishment in return, (please) have mercy on Your servant, O Allah, that is I myself, that is I myself. I am Your servant, O my Chief, I am Your servant; I am at Your disposal; O my Lord. O my God, in the name of Your Being, O my Hope, O my All-beneficent, O my Supporter, Your servant, Your servant, has no strategy. O Ultimate of my desire! O He Who makes blood run into the veins of Your slave! O my Chief, O my Master! O He Who is Unique! O He Who is Unique! O my Lord! I—Your servant, Your servant- have no strategy and I cannot avail myself and I have no control over loss or over profit. I do not find anyone from whom I may seek help; so, all profitable avenues have been blocked, and all my expectations have turned into disappointments. Helpless and forsaken I came to You, So, I have presented myself before You in this current stand. O my God, You are aware of all that which I speak about. So, how would You deal with me? If I but knew how would You dispense with my prayer? Would You say, ‘Yes’ or ‘No’? If You say ‘No,’ then I am ruined! I am ruined! I am ruined! Woe to me! Woe to me! Woe to me! Oh my misery! Oh my misery! Oh my misery! Oh my ill-luck! Oh my ill-luck! Oh my ill- luck! To whom? By Whom? From whom? How? What? In which place to take shelter? For whom shall I hope? Who shall bestow upon me with his favor when You forsake me? O Liberal in forgiveness! But if You say ‘Yes,’ as I expect You to say and as I desire from You, then joy is for me, I am successful, I am happy; then joy is for me, I will receive (Your) mercy. O Ever-merciful! O Ever-compassionate! O Ever-sympathetic! O Ever- commiserating! O Ever-sovereign! O Just! I lack any act due to which I can attain achievement of my desire. I thus beseech You in the name of Your Name which You have reserved in the innermost of Your Hidden Knowledge and it has thus settled with You so firmly that nothing of it can come out from You to any other thing. I beseech You by it and by You, for it is certainly the most exalted and honored of Your Names. I have nothing to mention except this, and no one can be more beneficent to me than You. O Absolute Being! O Creator of creation! O He Who has introduced Himself to me! O He Who has commanded me to obey Him! O He Who has warned me against disobeying Him! O He Who is besought! O He Who is pleaded! O He Who is desired! I have overlooked Your instructions, which You gave me and have not obeyed You. If I obeyed You in what You have ordered me, You would certainly grant my requests that I am presenting before You. In spite of my transgression, I am hopeful for You. So, do not let my hope remain unfulfilled. O He Who always has mercy upon me, keep me safe, under Your protection, from (all evils that are) before me, behind me, above me, below me, and from all sides that surround me. O Allah, [I beseech You] in the name of Muhammad, my master, and [in the name of] 'Ali, my chief, and [in the names of] the orthodox Imams (leaders), peace be upon them, (please) bestow upon us with Your blessings, compassions, and mercy; and grant us expansive shares of Your sustenance; and help us repay our debts and settle all our needs, O Allah, O Allah, O Allah. Verily, You have full power over all things.

The Imam (a.s.) then added: One who offers this prayer and says this supplication will have all his sins forgiven.

The Imam (a.s.) answered, “Save me from your inventions! Whenever a disaster befalls you, you should have recourse to the Messenger of Allah and offer a two-unit prayer and dedicate it to him, peace be upon him and his Household.”

“How can I do that?” I asked.

The Imam (a.s.) answered, “You should bathe yourself and offer a two-unit prayer, beginning it with the prefatory part of obligatory prayers and say the tashahhud statement of obligatory prayers. When you finish saying the tashahhud and Taslim statements, you should say the following:

اَللّٰهُمَّ اَنْتَ السَّلَامُ وَ مِنْكَ السَّلَامُ وَ اِلَيْكَ يَرْجِعُ السَّلَامُ اَللّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ بَلِّغْ رُوْحَ مُحَمَّدٍ مِنِّىْ السَّلَامَ وَ اَرْوَاحَ الْاَئِمَّةِ الصَّادِقِيْنَ سَلَامِىْ وَارْدُدْ عَلَىَّ مِنْهُمُ السَّلَامَ وَالسَّلَامُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللّٰهِ وَ بَرَكَاتُهُ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِنَّ هَاتَيْنِ الرَّكْعَتَيْنِ هَدِيَّةٌ مِنِّىْ اِلٰى رَسُوْلِ اللّٰهِ صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَ اٰلِهٖ فَاَثِبْنِىْ عَلَيْهِمَا مَا اَمَّلْتُ وَ رَجَوْتُ فِيْكَ وَ فِىْ رَسُوْلِكَ يَا وَلِىَّ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ۔

You may then prostrate and repeat the following forty times:

يَا حَىُّ يَا قَيُّوْمُ،يَا حَيُّا لَا يَمُوْتُ،يَا حَيًّا لَاۤ اِلٰهَ اِلَّاۤ اَنْتَ،يَا ذَا الْجَلَالِ وَ الْاِكْرَامِ،يَا اَرْحَمَ‏ الرَّاحِمِيْنَ۔

You may then put your right cheek on the ground and repeat the aforesaid supplication forty times. You may then put your left cheek on the ground and repeat the supplication more forty times.

You may then raise your head from prostration, extend your hands (towards the sky) and repeat the supplication forty times. You may then pull your hands to your neck, point out with your forefinger, and repeat the supplication forty times. You may then hold your beard with your left hand and weep, or try to weep, and say the following:

يَا مُحَمَّدُ يَا رَسُوْلَ اللّٰهِ اَشْكُوْ اِلَى اللّٰهِ وَ اِلَيْكَ حَاجَتِىْ وَ اِلٰى اَهْلِ بَيْتِكَ الرَّاشِدِيْنَ حَاجَتِىْ وَ بِكُمْ اَتَوَّجَهُ اِلَى اللّٰهِ فِىْ حَاجَتِىْ۔

You should then prostrate and repeat the following word as much as one breath can take:

يَا اَللهُ يَا اللهُ۔

You may then say the following:

صَلِّ عَلٰى مُحَمَّدٍ وَّ اٰلِ مُحَمَّدٍ۔

You may now mention your need.

If you do so, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) added, I guarantee that Allah the Almighty and Majestic will settle your need before you leave your place.”""",

ALLAHUMMA ANTAA AS-SALAAMO WA MINKA AS-SLAAMO WA ILAYKA YARJIOS-SALAAMO ALLAHUMMA SALLI ALA MOHAMMADIW WA AALI MOHAMMADIN WA BALLIG RUHA WA MOHAMMADIN MINNIS-SALAAMA WA ARWAAHAL-AIMMATIS-SAADIKINA SALAAMI WA-ARDUD ALAYYA MINHUMOS-SALAAMA WAS-SALAAMO ALAYHIM WA RAHMATULLAHI WA BARAKATOHO.ALLAHUMMA INNA HAATAINIR-RAKATAINI HADIYYATUN MINNI ILAA RASOOLILLAHI SALLALAHO ALAYHI WA AALEHI FA-AASIBNI ALAYHIMAA MAA AMMALTO WA RAJAUV-TO FIKA WA FI RASOOLIKA YA WALIYYIL MOMININ.

You may then prostrate and repeat the following forty times:

YA HAYYO YA QAYYUMO,YA HAYYO LA YA MUTO,YA HAYYAN LAA ILAAHA ILLA ANTA,YA ZALJALAALI WAL IKRAAMI,YA ARHAMAR-RAHIMIN

You may then put your right cheek on the ground and repeat the aforesaid supplication forty times. You may then put your left cheek on the ground and repeat the supplication more forty times.

You may then raise your head from prostration, extend your hands (towards the sky) and repeat the supplication forty times. You may then pull your hands to your neck, point out with your forefinger, and repeat the supplication forty times. You may then hold your beard with your left hand and weep, or try to weep, and say the following:

YA MOHAMMADO YA RASOOLALAHI ASHKO ILALLAHI WA ILAYKA HAAJATI WA BIKUM ATAWAJJAHO ILALLAHI FI HAAJATI

You should then prostrate and repeat the following word as much as one breath can take:

YA ALLAHO,YA ALLAHO

You may then say the following:

SALLI ALAA MOHAMMADIW WA-AALE MOHAMMADIN

You may now mention your need.

If you do so, Imam al-Sadiq(a.s.) added, I guarantee that Allah the Almighty and Majestic will settle your need before you leave your place.”""",

In each unit, recite Surah al-Faatehah, but when you reach the following verse, you should repeated it one hundred times:

اِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَ اِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِيْنُ۔

You may then recite the next verses of Surah al-Faatehah and then recite Surah al-Tawheed two hundred times. Upon accomplishment of the prayer, you may repeat the following statement seventy times:

لَا حَوْلَ وَ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِاللهِ الْعَلِىِّ الْعَظِيْمِ۔

You may then prostrate and repeat the following word of supplication two hundred times:

يَا رَبِّ۔
