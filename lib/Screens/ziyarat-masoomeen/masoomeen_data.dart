1->Holy Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.a.) - from Birth to Proclamation:

Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad Ibn Abdullah (s.a.w.a.) was born in Makkah on 17" Rabiul Awwal 570 A.D. (53 years before migration to Madinah).The holy parents of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a) were Janab-e-Abdullah Ibn Abdul Muttalib (a.s.) and Janab-e-Aamenah binte Wahab(s.a). The year in which Holy Prophet(s.a.w.a.) was born is famous as Year of Elephant". The respected father of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) expired while he was still not born. His father expired on his way when he was returning from a trade trip to Syria. 

At age of six and eight years, he (s.a.w.a.) lost his beloved mother and benevolent grandfather, Janab-e-Abdul Muttalib (a.s.) respectively. Before the death of his grandfather, he was handed in the guardianship of his uncle, Janab-e-Abu Talib(a.s.).
___________
The Arabian Peninsula was covered in the darkness of ignorance and paganism. All sorts of evil and vices were predominant. Idol worshipping, bloodshed, burying daughters alive, etc. were common at that place.In such a dull environment where the only sign ofculture was poetry, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was brought up. He kept himself busy in grazing the cattle along with his grand father and his uncle. Despite staying in this filthy environment, his character was not in the least affected nor his thoughts influenced.Allah guards whom He selects for the great task of Prophethood.

The Holy Quran declares in [SURAH AN-AAM(6):Verse 124]:
{Allah best knows where He places His message.}

In his youth, he traveled with a trade caravan to Syria along with his uncle, Janabe Abu Talib (a.s.). It was in this journey that his honesty, intelligence, cleverness, skill and other moral qualities were illuminated. These noble qualities were the reason of his becoming the head of the trade caravan of Janab-e-Khadija binte Khuwailid(s.a), the richest lady of Arabia. Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)
handled the trade caravan very successfully. At the age of 25, he married Janab-e-Khadijah (s.a).During the forty years of his life before proclamation, Holy
Prophet (s.a.w.a.) infused life in to the dead society of the Arabs by his honesty, truthfulness, chastity, purity, bravery, etc. His pure,unblemished and sublime character earned him the titles of 'Ameen' (Trustworthy) and 'Sadiq' (Truthful). These titles and praises from enemies highlight his towering and immaculate personality.The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) often visited the "Cave of Hera'. There he spent his time worshipping Allah and pondering over His creation. In one of his visits to the cave, Hazrat Jibraeel (a.s.) called upon him with a message from Allah (s.w.t.) to announce the commencement of his prophetic mission. Thus, his Prophethood was formally announced'. 
___________
2->Holy Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.a.) - From Proclamation to Migration..

On the night of 27 Rajab, 13 years before migration, Hazrat Jibrael (a.s.) came to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) in the cave of Hera and revealed the following five verses of Surah Alaq(96):Versees 1-5:

[Read in the name of Your Lord who created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is the Most Honorable. He taught (to write) with the pen. Taught man what he knew not.']

After this revelation, the gigantic task of propagation of religion by the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was launched.The tone of the first revelation shows that the teachings of Islam are based on knowledge and education rather tham rituals that have no basis whatsoever.

The first persons who apparently accepted the claim of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) were none other than his paternal cousin MAULA ALI(A.S) and his wife BIBI KHADIJA(S.A).

For the next three years,holy prophet(s.a.w.a) invited his near ones secrately towards the mission.At this juncture,people like Janabe AMMAR and his parents Janabe YASEER and Janabe SOMAIYYA accepted islam. 

Finally,Allah ordered Holy Prophet(s.a.w.a) to warn and call his relatives towards his mission.He(sa.wa) then invited his near relatives (nearly 45 elders) from amongst the Bani Hashim for dinner to call them to Islam
This feast became famous in history as "Feast of Clan" and also known as Dawaat-e-Zul Asheera.

In this feast, Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) invited his near relatives towards Allah and declared that whoever helps him in his great mission, will be his brother and his vicegerent. 

His brother Imam Ali (a.s.), who at that time was around 13 years of age, stood up in the crowd to declare his support to the call of the Holy Prophet(s.a.w.a.) and promised to help the religion of Islam.Thus, HolyProphet (s.a.w.a.) embarked on the mission to propagate the belief,There is no god except Allah'.
___________
3->Events after the Demise of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a)

The Holy Prophet (sa.wa), from the first day of his mission introduced the people to his successor i.e Imam Ali (as) on numerous occasions.

The Following are some of the instances as follows:

1-Hadees-e-Yaumuddar: (On the day he (s.awa.) invited his near relatives to lslam Also referred to as Dawaat e Zul-Asheerah).

2-Hadees-e-Raayat: (When he (saw.a) gave the flag and the command to Imam Ali (as) in the battle of Khaiber)

3-Hadees-e-Manzelat: (When he (a.w.a) showed simlarity between him and Imam Ali (as) as Prophet Musa (a.s) had with Prophet Harun (a.s))

4-Hadees-e-Ghadeer: (This took place while he (s.a.w.a) was returning from last Hajj)

5-Hadees-e-Saqalain: (About the two weighey things viz. the Holy Quran and the Ahle Bait (as).

Various Quranic verses too pont towards the leadership and mastership of Imam Ali (as)

___________
Notwithstanding these clear indications, the Muslims breached the words of the Holy Quran and the sayings of Holy Prophet(s.a.w.a.) by gathering at a place called Saqifa Bani Saaedah.A group of people among whom the foremost were Abu Bakr, Umar, Saad bin Obada and Abu Obaida Jarrah gathered at Saqifa to elect a successor from among themselves, while the body of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was still lying unbathed and unshrouded. Such gathering was the result of not having faith in the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). They considered worldly power and authority more important than carrying out the last rites of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). The rampaging and turbulent gathering at Saqifa elected Abu Bakr as the caliph and successor of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). People who had no connection with Islam accepted this decision. 

Madinah, the backbone of Islam, returned back to tribal fanaticism. During the twenty-five years from the demise of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) i.e. from 10 A.H. to 35 A.H., three caliphs came into power and each of them were appointed in different ways. The appointment of Abu Bakar took place in Saqifa. He ruled for 3 years after which Umar came to power. Before he expired he appointed Umar to taken on the responsibility of the Caliphate. So, Umar came to power through nomination. In 12 years of Umar's rule, Muslims achieved military victories over Iran and Rome. However, while the Muslims were crossing all physical boundaries on one hand, on the other they were moving away from the pure teachings of the Holy Quran and the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.). Umar in his last days devised another mode of appointment of Caliph. He made a committee of six members that comprised of Imam Ali (a.s.), Talhah, Zubair, Usman, Saad bin Abi Waqqas and Abdur Rahman lbn Auf.

Finally, as desired by Umar, the mantle of Caliphate came on the shoulders of Usman. In the 10 years of Usman's governance, ignorant and tribal customs done away with by Islam were restored. People were divided on the basis of relationship With the ruler, tribes, castes, social position etc. Bani Ummayya, open enemies of Islam seized the opportunity to raise their head in the society and create disturbances. Syria became the power-centre of the Ummayyids.""",

1->Born:

Bibi Fatema(S.A) was born at a time when the holy prophet had lost his three sons i.e(QASSIM,TAYYEB,TAHIR).The quraish had scornfully given the tittle of 'ABTAR' to Holy Prophet as he was devoid of a son.Consequently, Allah, the Almighty, revealed Surah Kauthar Hazrat Fatema (s.a.w.a.) was born to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a

Surely, We have given you abundance (kauthar).Therefore pray to your Lord and make a sacrifice Surely, your enemy is the one who shall be without posterity.Hazrat Fatema (s.a.) received the best possible training in environment of revelation. She became familiar to the sublime and lofty personalities of her parents at a very young age.Hazrat Fatema (s.a.w.a.) has various titles that manifest her personality.The infancy of Hazrat Fatema (s.a.) passed in exile in "Sheb-e-Abi Talib' where the Muslims were forced to stay for three years. After the Muslims returned from exile, she lost her loving and affectionate mother. She saw her father striving hard to propagate Islam and withstand the tyranny of Quraish.

After the migration of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) the second batch of Muslims who migrated under the leadership of Imam Ali (a.s.) included Hazrat Fatema (s.a.). They met the Holy Prophet(S.a.w.a.) at a place called Quba'. Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) participated in many wars in his ten year stay in Madinah. While proceeding towards battlefield, she would be the last person whom he (s.a.w.a.) bid farewell. On his return, the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) would meet her first.

As time passed, Hazrat Fatema (s.a.) became famous for her spirituality, knowledge, generosity, worship etc. Many marriage
roposals came from famous Arabs like (Abu Bakr, Umar, Abdur Rahman Ibn Auf,) etc. but she rejected them all. Finally, on divine command, Imam Ali (a.S.) proposed for her (a.s.). The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) took consent from his daughter Fatema (s.a.) about the proposal, who accepted it without hesitation.

A society where girls were buried alive got a new facet to it wherein the girl was given freedom to accept the marriage proposal, This shows the independence of decision-making given to women in Islam.

The marriage of Hazrat Fatema (s.a.) became a model for the Muslims to follow. The dowry of the daughter of the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.a.) was so simple that one cannot believe that a Prophet who was Commanding great esteem and respect in the entire Muslim world arranged for such a simple dowry. This marriage was opposed to marriages where there are unlimited difficulties involved and extravagance is the order of the day.
Bibi Fatema (s.a.) born five children. [Imam Hasan (a.s.),  Imam Hussain (a.s.), Bibi Zainab (a.s.) and Bibi Kulsum (a.s.).] Éach one of them exhibited outstanding character, which manifested their training and upbringing. The fifth was Maula Mohsin (a.s.) who was martyred by the oppressive Muslims while he had not yet stepped into this world.
Hazrat Fatema (s.a.) was a sacrificing daughter for her father, a loyal wife to her husband, a compassionate mother to her children
and a helpful and cooperative master to the servant of her house.
___________
2->FADAK......(MAY ALLAH CURSE THOSE(1,2,3,) WHO USURPED THE RIGHTS OF BIBI SAYYEDA(S.A)
The Holy Prophet (S.a.w.a.) had gifted the "Fadak to Bibi Fatema (S.a.), usurped by the Caliph after his fathers death Fadak was a village 140 kms from Madinah, which used to be a center of the Jews. After the battle ot Khaibar, the possessors of Fadak laid down arms favoring peace. They agreed to give half of their yearly income from their fields to the Holy Prophet (s.a w).This was gifted by the Holy Prophet (S.a.w.a.) to Bibi Zahra(S.a.).

___________
4-Mazlumiyat-E-Bibi Sayyeda(S.A)
The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) died in 11 A.H. and this was the beginning of unbearable difficulties for her. She was aggrieved and sorrowful by the death of her father. But this sorrow was not limited. It increased when the rightful Caliphate of Imam Ali (a.s.) was usurped. "Fadak', which was gifted by the Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.a.) was also taken away from her. People objected to her mourning. 

Imam Ali (a.s.) built a house famous as 'Baitul Huzn'(House of Grief) so that she can mourn for her father without disturbing the people.
This was not the end of her ordeals. The enemies were not satisfied with the usurpation of her property and the caliphate of Imam Ali(a.s.). 

Rather they came to the house of Hazrat Fatema (s.a.) with fire to burn down her house. She stood against the door and tried to stop the enemies from taking away Imam Ali (a.s.). 

But the stonehearted oppressors burnt the door and it fell upon the holy body of Hazrat Fatema (s.a.). This resulted in the miscarriage of her fifth child Mohsin. However, she bore all the difficulties patiently. Her grief and affliction was such that she used to cry

Such great misfortune has fallen on me, that had it falle on a bright day, it would have turned into a gloomy night.Even in the condition of injury, she never forgot about the Imam of the time. 

During the nights, she along with Ameerul Momeneen(a.s.) visited the companions of Holy Prophet (S.a.w.a.) reminded them about their responsibilities but they preferred the world to the hereafter.

Finally, she left this world (75 days or 90) days after the death of her father

She made the following will in her last days:

{I should be buried in the night and those who have harassed me should not participate in my burial}

Thus making it clear for all that she left this world in a condition of anger with those who had usurped Fadak and the Caliphate.

While burying Janabe Zahra (s.a.), Imams Ali (a.s.) entreated to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) thus:

(Fatima your daughter is present before you. You enquire from her what the people did to us after you).

MAY ALLAH CURSE THOSE PEOPLE WHO HARRASED BIBI SAYYEDA(S.A).

MAY ALLAH CURSE QUNFUZ MALOON.

MAY ALLAH CURSE AALE SAUD.

MAY ALLAH CURSE JIBT WAT TAGHOOT.

MAY ALLAH CURSE THOSE WHO DO ITTEHAD WITH THE KILLERS OF BIBI SAYYEDA(S.A).""",

2->[The First Period - Contemporary Life with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)..]

This period comprised of 33 years of Imam (a.s.)'s life in the service of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and Islam. The life of Imam Ali(a.s.) was the result of divine training in the tutelage of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) who said:
Allah trained me and I trained Ali.

The aim of the life of Imam Ali (a.s.) whether in Makkah or in Madinah was to defend Islam and the Muslims. In Makkah, he was the first man to believe in the Prophethood of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). He was the lone defender of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) shielding him from the taunts of Quraish. He (a.s.) was the one who slept on the bed of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) in the night of migration.

Behaarul Anwaar, Vol. 3, p. 283, Hadees No. 1

His famous words on the night of migration still bear witness about his love towards Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) when he (a.s.) slept on his (s.a.w.a.) bed. He (a.s.) enquired from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.):

"By this act (sleeping on the bed of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)) will your life be saved?" After the affirmative reply of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) he slept peacefully in the night.

He (a.s.) remained in Makkah for few days after the migration as a trustee of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). After returning all the trusts in the custody of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), he (a.s.) left with a few ladies from Makkah towards Madinah. The disbelievers even attacked him on the way but fled on his courageous counter-attack.

In Madinah, he was always in forefront to defend Islam in the wars. He (a.s.) has the exclusive honor of being the brother of Holy
Prophet (s.a.w.a.).

Marriage with Janab-e-Zahra (a.s.) is another exclusive and unparalleled merit and virtue.

His bravery was praised by the enemies as well. When the sister of Amr Ibn Abdawud - killed by Hazrat Ali (a.s.) in the Battle of Khandaq - came to the corpse of her brother, she was surprised. For, Ali (a.s.) had not removed anything from his body, as was the customs among the Arabs. 

She composed a poem:

"If anyone other than Ali had killed my brother I would have went my whole life over the infamy. But now I will not cry. My brother
has been killed by a honorable and an upright man."

The character of a true Muslim is worthy of praise by friends as well as enemies.

The position of Imam Ali (a.s.) was further elevated by his inclusion in the 'Verse of Purification' (Ayat-e-Tatheer), 'Verse of Malediction' (Ayat-e-Mubaahelah) and the 'Verse of Love for Near Relatives' (Ayat-e-Mawwadah) by the command of Allah, the
High.

Imam Ali's (a.s.) position with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was like that of Prophet Haroon (a.s.) with Prophet Moosa (a.s.). The doors of all houses opening in the Masjid were closed except that of Ali
(a.s.).

Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) described him as the 'Gate of the City of Knowledge' and ordered the people to come through the gate to acquire knowledge and wisdom.

Imam Ali (a.s.)'s honor and glory peaked at Ghadeer Khum when the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) declared him to be his immediate successor and master of believers. He (s.a.w.a.) said to Ali (a.s.)

Your flesh is my flesh, your blood is my blood, peace with you is peace with me and war with you is war with me.

He (s.a.w.a.) also gave glad tidings to his followers (Shias) in these words:


(O Ali) Your Shias with shining faces will sit on the pulpits of light (Nur) in Paradise around me and they will be my neighbors.

History bears witness that throughout his 33 years of his life with Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) none was as close to Holy Prophet
(s.a.w.a.) as Ali (a.s.). Nobody can claim to be superior in faith over him nor can anyone match his virtues. All his actions were in consonance with that of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). He (a.s.) fought for the interpretation of the Holy Quran just as the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) fought for its descent. No accuser or mocker could stop him from the path of Truth.

Ameerul Momineen Ali (a.s.) was the most aware and knowledgeable about Islam at the time when Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) left this world. With Holy Prophet's (s.a.w.a.) death, the first stage of Imam Ali's (a.s.) life came to an end. It was the effect of his immense love for the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) that when others were busy in deciding about and usurping the caliphate.

He was busy in the bath and burial of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). Nothing could take him away from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.)
___________
3->[The Second Period - During the Caliphate of the three Caliphs]

As we have seen in Lesson 5, the events after the demise of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) deprived him (a.s.) for 25 years from his exclusive right to rule over the people. Some people wrongly think this period of Imam's (a.s.) life as confinement at home. If this was true, we would have not seen Islam today. Imam Ali (a.s.) was always in the forefront in guiding the Caliphs despite bearing the  deep pain for not being given his right. He describes his pain thus:
I adopted patience although there was a thorn in my eye and a bone in my throat. I was seeing my inheritance being plundered.'1

The most important work of Imam Ali (a.s.) in this period was the compilation and explanation of the Holy Quran. Ali (a.s.) was the writer of revelation and he always stayed in the company of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and had an encompassing knowledge about the revelation of Holy Quran. He (a.s.) completed the task of collecting the Quran in 6 days.

The Caliphs used to refer to him in their difficulties and to solve their queries. Keeping in view the overall benefit of Islam, Imam (a.s.) helped them and replied to their queries. 

The second caliph regularly declared:

(If Ali would have not been there Umar would have perished.)

The excellences of Imam Ali (a.s.) were so famous that Abu Bakr, himself confessed his (a.s.) superiority by declaring:

1.Nahjul Balaaghah, Sermon No. 3 famous as Khutba-e-Shiqshiqiyyah

2.Al-Ghadeer, Vol. 6, p. 110

Leave me, leave me, because I am not the best amongst you while Ali is in your midst.

The few trusted companions of Imam Ali (a.s.) like Salman, Miqdad, Ammar-e-Yasir, Abuzar, Malik-e-Ashtar etc. remained deadfastly on his (a.s.) leadership and mastership. They kept their hearts enlightened by his (a.s.) love and adoration.

Imam Ali (a.s.) was pained to see that on one hand, Islam was setting its foot in Iran and Rome and on the other hand, the ignorant prejudices of race, caste, nationality, etc. were rearing their ugly heads and contaminating the pure teachings of Islam.

The duration of 25 years in the life of Imam Ali (a.s.) is a lesson of sacrifice of one's rights for achieving the aim i.e. safety of Islam. Imam Ali (a.s.) did not wage a war with the usurpers of his rights because he was afraid. Never! Rather, he did so because there was danger to Islam from internal enemies like Abu Sufyan and external enemies like Rome who were waiting for an opportunity to destroy Islam.

This is clear from the reply of Imam Ali (a.s.) to Abu Sufyan when the latter had come to him with a plan to acquire for him his rightful claim. He (a.s.) retorted:

You have always been an enemy of Allah, His Islam and its followers.'

1.As Sawaaremul Mohreqah fi Naqd-es-Sawaaeqil Mohreqah by Qazi Nurullah Shustari (ra.). p. 216

I do not need your help or sympathy. You have always tried to harm Islam. By Allah, your only purpose of coming to me is to create dissension among the Muslims

His concern for Islam and unity among the Muslims can be vouched from his following words:

I swear by Allah that if there was no fear of discord and division among the Muslims, the return of infidelity to the Islamic land and the violation of religion of God, I would have been in a place other than the present one - (sarcastically indicating that he had the position of leadership in hand).2

Imam Ali (a.s.) chose patience in order to become a shield for Islam, Quran and the Muslims and thus protect them. With the
death of the third Caliph, the second stage of life of Imam Ali (a.s.) came to an end. Let us now have a brief look at the third phase.

1.Ad-Darajaat Ar-Rafeeah, p. 187

2.Sharho Nahjil Balaaghah by Ibn Abil Hadeed, Vol. 1, p. 307
___________    
4->[The Third Period - Imam Ali's (a.s.) Rule And Apparent Caliphate]

After the murder of the third Caliph, Muslims were tired of nepotism and favoritism and were in need of the original Islam. Hence, they flocked to the rightful successor of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). Ali (a.s.) was not interested in power and preferred to have a role of an advisor and guide to the Muslims, as he was well aware of the spoiled habits of the people and knew their character well. However, when the pressure increased and everyone was eager to pay their allegiance to him with all types of promises, he accepted the apparent caliphate to complete the argument on the people.1

After accepting the Caliphate, Imam Ali (a.s.) made clear the policy of his (a.s.) government: 

By Allah, even if I had found that by such money women have been married or slave maids have been purchased I would have returned it (to its owners from what Usman has given).2

He made it clear that he will not tolerate injustice in the, distribution of public wealth.

In another sermon, he (a.s.) said:
The low in my view is worthy of honour till I secure (his) right for him while the strong in my view weak till I take (other's) right from him.3

People who had become used to favouratism and nepotism did not like this attitude of justice and equity, giving rise to opposition and hatred. Among these, Talha and Zubair were also seen. They realized that they would not be successful in the reign of Imam Ali (a.s.) and their ill-gotten wealth would be confiscated for the
benefit of Muslim Treasury.

Another group of opposition was formed when Imam Ali (a.s.) dismissed Moaviyah, a representative of the Bani Umayyah from the governorship of Syria.

1.To know the condition of the people while paying allegiance to Imam Ali (a.s.), one may refer to Nahjul Balaaghah, Sermons 53,136 & 227.

2.Nahjul Balaaghah, Sermon No. 37

3.Nahjul Balaaghah, Sermon No. 15

Imam Ali (a.s.) made it clear to the people that he would not give  any opportunity for oppression in his rule.

Imam Ali (a.s.) in his short duration as a ruler over the Muslim was involved in three major wars with different factions of Muslims.

Talha and Zubair, on getting the opportunity, fled to Makkah and joined hands with Ayesha. They were joined with few others from Yemen and Basra and alleged that Ali (a.s.) was the root cause for the third caliph's murder. This slogan became the cause for the first internal battle amongst the Muslims i.e. Battle of Jamal, while
Talha and Zubair were well aware that Ali (a.s.) had no role in the third Caliph's murder.

Meanwhile, according to the need of the time Ali (a.s.), shifted his capital from Madinah to Kufa.

Following the order of his dismissal, Moaviyah prepared an army to fight Imam Ali (a.s.), who also prepared for the confrontation. Taking advantage of the situation, Talha and Zubair proceeded towards Basra along with Ayesha. 

She rode a camel and entered the battlefield. This encounter became famous as the Battle of Jamal (Camel). When Imam Ali (a.s.) heard this, he changed his plan of going to Syria and departed towards Basra. Finally. a severe battle took place in Basra leaving Talha and Zubair dead and the camel of Ayesha maimed. This battle took place in 36 A.H.

Talha and Zubair were associated with Islam from the age of 23 years and 25 years respectively but were killed fighting against the truthful successor of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). This incident teaches us that one should not be deceived into personality worshipping. The truth should be the criteria and not persons. Also, one should never consider himself more important than the Divine Proof, otherwise destruction of this world as well as the Hereafter is guaranteed.

The second military encounter took place in 37 A. H. between the army of Imam Ali (a.s.) and Moaviyah. The battle took place at Siffeen, which is between Kufa and Syria. This battle was about to end in Moaviyah's defeat but the situation suddenly turned on its head due to the scheming suggestion of Amr Ibn Aas. The Syrian army put the Quran on the spear and asked for arbitration thereby deceiving the soldiers of Imam Ali (a.s.), who tried convincing them that it was not more than a ruse but to no avail. The situation worsened and some people from Imam Ali (a.s.)'s army bared their swords and threatened to kill Imam (a.s.) if he did not call back Maalik-e-Ashtar (a.r.), the commander of the army.

At that moment, Maalik-e-Ashtar (a.r.) was moving swiftly towards the enemy camp and was on the verge of capturing the tent of Moaviyah. Finally, Maalik-e-Ashtar (a.r.) was called back and Imam (a.s.) accepted the arbitration.

He (a.s.) was compelled to accept Abu Musa Ashari as an arbitrator instead of Janabe Maalik-e-Ashtar (a.r.) whom Imam(as.) had proposed. As expected, Amr Ibn Aas deceived Abu Musa Ashari. A sure victory converted to defeat for the army of Imam (a.s) due to one person. This battle resulted in unbearable losses for the Muslims. Some of the loyal companions of Imam (a.s.) were martyred in this battle. Among them was Janab Ammar Yasir(a.r.), who was fighting along with Imam Ali (a.s.) at a very old age. The martyrdom of Janab Ammar (a.r.) was prophesied by Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) when he (s.a.w.a.) said to him: "O Ammar you will be killed by an unjust group".1

Ali (a.s.) was very sad on his martyrdom. He (a.s.) kept the head of Ammar (a.r.) on his lap and said: "O death which will finally seize all, now that you are taking all my friends away from me, embrace me too".2

Old age is no barrier for obedience, sacrifice and steadfastness on the right path.

The war ended but not before laying the foundation of a third military confrontation. The same group who had pressurized Imam(a.s.) to accept arbitration blamed Imam (a.s.) for the defeat and raised the slogan that that Imam (a.s.) has gone out of religion and has brought disgrace to the Muslims (we seek refuge in Allah!!).Abdullah Ibn Wahb, the leader of this group raised an army of 10000 soldiers. They were called as Khaarijis. Imam (a.s.) convincingly defeated these foolish and fanatical people in Naharwan. The battle of Naharwan was a clash between two groups of Muslims with opposite Islamic beliefs.

Every idea, ideology, view and action which is not approved by the infallible Imam (a.s.) is void, even though those who hold such
ideology are apparently Muslims. Fanaticism and religiousness
without any essence leads to defeat and disgrace.

After the war, Imam (a.s.) once again was busy thinking about Moaviyah but due to the short span of his (a.s.) rule, he could not take effective action against Moaviyah. In addition, the dealing of Moaviyah with the people was very much different from the dealings of Ali (a.s.). Imam (a.s.) did not show the slightest
consideration even to the near and dear ones while Moaviyah bribed people through different ways and means just to make them switch loyalties. Such people were like parasites; they prayed with Imam (a.s.) and ate with Moaviyah.

During the five years of rule, Imam (a.s.) was put to all kinds of physical and mental persecution and troubles. The sermons of
Nahjul Balaaghah are full of remembrances of his sorrows. 

He possessed distinct qualities at one and the same time - A valiant warrior and sympathetic and emotional person towards the poor people. He was a great statesman who would not neglect observance of religious knowledge. He was a great orator who in his speeches would very beautifully express wise matters and difficult concepts of Islam. In brief, he was the model of Islam and Quran and having the same behavior as the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.).

The speeches, letters and sayings of Imam (a.s.) have been collected by the Shia Scholar Sayyed Razi (a.r.) in the book Nahjul Balaghah. 

Finally, in the morning of 19th of Ramazan, 40 A.H., the sun that rose from the House of Allah set in the House of Allah when Imam
(a.s.) was martyred by Ibn Muljam (l.a.) in the prayer-niche of Masjid-e-Kufa,and saying the sentence,

BY THE LORD OF KAABA I HAVE SUCCEED.""",

___________
1->Born:

Imam Hasan (a.s.) was the first child born in the family of Ali (a.) and Fatema (s.a.).The news of his birth made the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) very happy. According to the Islamic tradition. he (s.a.w.a.) himself recited the Azaan and lqaamah in the ears of his grandson and named him 'Hasan'. 'Mujtaba' is the famous title of Imam Hasan (a.s.). 

The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) performed his 'aqeeqah' on the seventh day after his (a.s.) birth. This holy practice is still prevelant among Muslims.'Imam Hasan (a.s.) lived for nearly eight years with the Holy prophet (s.a.w.a.) and his mother Janabe Fatema (s.a.). 

The immense love and affection of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) for Imam Hasan (a.s.) was evident for all. Right from the beginning of In childhood. Imain (a.s.) gained education and training in the house of revelation. 

He would listen to the sayings of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) in the Masjid everyday and repeat them for his (as.) respected mother (s.a.) at home. His mother (s.a.) used to be delighted with the precision of these narrations. After the shahadath of his grandfather and mother. Imam (a.s.) lived with his father for thirty years. He (a.s.) stayed in the company of his father and in the period of Caliphate of his father, he was considered amongst his close advisors. 

Numerous advises given by Imam Ali (a.s.) to his son are an indication of their close proximity.His unmatched valour was witnessed in the battles of Jamal,Siffeen and Naharwan. He Was always seen in the forefront in the battlelines and none else was able to surpass him (a.s.). In the battle of Siffeen, he showed such selflessness and fought so bravely in the midst of the enemies that Ali (a.s.) said to a group of his companions to go immediately to stop Imam Hasan (a.s.), and Imam Husain (a.s.) from fighting. The reason for this was that they were lighting so fiercely and in such a manner that Ali (a.s.) feared the termination of the progeny of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) upon their death in battle field.
___________
2->The Caliphate of Maula Hasan(a.s):

At the age of 37. Imam Hasan (a.s.) became the divine Caliph after the martyrdom of Imam Ali (a.s.).The ways and manners of Imam's (as.) life are illuminative and educative for us. His moral character and behaviour was proverbial and famous amongst the people. Food and wealth were distributed to the poor and needy people from his (a.s.) house. 

Inspire of his honourable family background. he (a.s.) accepted the invitation of poor people and sat in their company to eat food on the ground. He thus fought against the social norms of class distinction. He showed that Islamic laws do not recognize aristocracy and class distinction. The noblest individual i.e. Imam (a.s.) would sit next to the lowest person (according to the criteria laid down by the society) of the society,thus practically demonstrating that the only source of virtue and excellence in Islam was piety. 
___________
3->Greatness of Character:

When Moaviyah failed in his attempts to defile the great status and affection for Imam Hasan (a.s.) even after the peace treaty, he schemed to sully the reputation of Imam ta.s.) with the help of some wretched individuals. They alleged that Imam (a.s.) used to marry and divorce many women and had more than 50 wives. 

The following become clear from analyzing the history with regards to these allegations: These accustions were spread by Moaviyah. The main propagandist was Ali Ibn Muhammad Ibn Ahdullah Madaaeeni. He was a courtier of Moaviyah and recited his eulogies. Though Moaviyah spread such propaganda through him.He could not get these accusations authenticated.Thus one of the important authors from among the Sehaah-e-Sittah has considered him as unreliable.Ahmed Ibne hambal the leader of hambali sect has also declared him to be liar and fake.

It is easy to lie but very difficult to false propagandist will suffer the severest of punishment on day of Judgement. An analysis of the personalities of these people reveals the fact that these were the results of the efforts of Moaviyah and Bani Ummayah who tried to malign the personality of Imam (as.) with their cowardly deeds. Unfortunately, the effect of the propaganda of Moaviyah can be seen even today. Ocassionally, we witness this fact that the position of Imam Hasan (a.s.) in the minds of some people with weak beliefs is subject to instability. Unfortunately, Imam Hasan (a.s.) is not considered by them to be of the same stature as Imam Ali (a.s.) and Imam Husain (a.s.).This is incorrect and a great injustice.
___________
4->War and Peace:

People who are unaware of the truth and divine teachings. exaggerate the differences between the peace of Imam Hasan (a.s.) and the uprising of Imam Husain (a.s.). Such people are oblivious of the following: 

Every step of Imam (a.s.) is according to divine will.Imam (a.s.) always acts for the benefit of the Ummat and never in self-interest.Imamat is a divine position not connected to any war or peace. Allah grants this position to His infallible servants and an infallible is free from any fault. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) has already replied to this objection in traditions: 

1."Both Hasan(a.s.) and Husain(a.s.) are Imams whether they are standing or seated.

2.Both Hasan (a.s.) and Husain (a.s.) are the leaders of the youths of Paradise"' 

Rising or being seated over here indicates peace and war. Thus. they are Imams whether they enter into peace or war! Besides, the leadership in Paradise will be acquired by only the one who has not disobeyed his Lord in the least and who led a successful life in light of divine teachings. 
___________
5->Martyrdom of Maula Hasan(a.s): 

In spite of all this, the personality of Imam (a.s.) left deep impressions on the hearts. Due to this,the Caliphs of Bani Umayyah were always afraid. Consequently, they were also always jealous of the family of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) [They were ignorant of the fact that this effect was due to divine mastership which could never be bought by people like Moaviyah on the basis of power and wealth. It can never he destroyed by the speakers and writers who were on the payroll of the Ummayid government.].Moaviyah did not fulfil any condition of the peace accord. By appointing Yazid(la) as his successor.he would never ever nominate any successor.He knew that Imam Hasan (as.) would object to his transgressions and hence he started exploring possibilities for assassinating Imam Hasan (a.s.). On many occasions his agents unsuccessfully tried to poison Imam Hasan (a.s.). 

Finally, he took help of the treacherous wife of Imam (as.), Ju'da bin Ash'ath ibne Qays al-Kindi.He promised her a hundred thousand dirhams and marriage with Yazid, if she poisons her husband. Finally, on 28 th Safar, 50 A.H. coinciding with the death anniversary of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), Imam (a.s.) at the age of 47 years was martyred in Madinah. In accordance with his last wishes, the holy body of Imam (a.s.) was taken to the tomb of Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) for circumbulation and to be buried near the grave of his grandfather.' But Ayesha, due to her past malice with the family members of Imam Ali (a.s.) prevented them from doing so. 

Finally. the holy body of Imam (a.s.) was buried in Jannatul Baqi. Till the year 1344 A.H. a tomb existed over his holy grave. However on 8' Shawwal of that year, the tomb of Imam Hasan (a.s.) along with other infallibles  buried in Jannatul Baqi was razed to the ground'.This was the act of the GOVT of saudi arabia under the influence of Wahabism.""",

1->Born:

MAULA Hussain(as) was born on 3rd Shabaan 4A.H.He was the second son of maula ali(as) and bibi fatema(sa).Like the elder brother he was also cherished by the Holy Prophet(s.a.w.a).The following tradition aptly expresses the high position and the love which the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) had for Imam Husain (a.s.): 

Husain is from me and I am from Husain. 0 Allah! Love him who loves Husain.' 

The Prophet's Love As mentioned previously, on this occasion Allah sent a green tablet to the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) who in turn gifted it to Janabe Fatema(s.a.) on the birth of Imam Husain (a.s.).Allah, the Almighty, has introduced Imam Husain (a.s.) in Hadith-e-Lauh.
___________
2->The Leader of the Martyrs: 

He is superior to all the martyrs and he is ranked above all the martyrs.I have kept with him, My complete word (of divine recognition) and My explicit proof (of Imamat).I would reward and punish on the basis of (affection for) his children.
___________
3->Letter to Moaviyah:

In the year 53 A.H.. three years after the commencement of the in Imamat of Imam Husain (a.s.). when Moaviyah tried to seek oath of allegiance of Muslims for his accursed son Yazid. Imam (as.) opposed it severely and refused to give his oath of allegiance.
Moaviyah, who was well aware of the approach of an Imam. thought it prudent to give up his idea of seeking allegiance from an Imam Husain (a.s.). In a letter to Moaviyah. Imam Husain(as) wrote: 

Surely,I am not aware of any conviracy greater and bigger than your mastership upon the nation.

In another place. where Moaviyah had written that Imam Husain intended to oppose him and wage a war against him. Imam Husain (a.s.) replied to him: 

By Allah! I fear Allah if i desist from it (war against you) and I believe that Allah too is not content to desist from it (the fight against you) and your oppressive and irreligious followers and the friends of Satan.'These words of Imam Husain amply clarify that the silence of Imam Husain (a.s.) was not due to any weakness but due to putting the interest of the people before everything. The tone of Imam Husain's (a.s.) reply speaks volumes about his courage and bravery. 
___________
4->Nomination of Yazid (L.A.) 

In the month of Rajah,. 60 A.H.. Moaviyah expired and in clear contravention of the terms of the peace treaty his son. Yazid took over the reins of the government in his filthy hands. He was a coarse and licentious person with a childish and immature mentality, Despite his loose character, he usurped the Caliphate and confronted Imam Husain (a.s.) by seeking the oath or allegiance from him (a.s.). The first order issued by Yazid was to Walid Ibn Ataba. Governor of Madinah to get the allegiance of Imam (a.s.) or to send the head of Imam (a.s.) to Syria. 
___________
5->Towards Makkah 

As soon as he received Yazid's order. Walid Ibn Ataba raised the matter with Imam (a.s.) but he (a.s.) demanded that such important decisions be taken in front of the Muslims during the day time and not in the darkness of the night. Walid agreed but his close companion, Marwan Ibn Hakam rebuked him and advised him to behead Imam(a.s) immediately on his refusal to pay allegiance.On hearing this suggestion,Imam(a.s) Slammed marwan in following words.

[Are You Threatening me with death,O Son of BLUE EYED WOMAN??.]

Imam refused to pay allegiance to Ya-zid,In the night Imam Hussain (a.s.) went to the grave of his grandfather the Holy Prophet of Islam (s.a.w.a.) and narrated the entire situation to him. He (a.s.) lett Madinah for Makkah during the day along with his family members. While leaving Madinah, Imam Husain (as.) wrote a letter to his brother Muhammad bin Hanafiyya in which he clearly spelt out the aim of his uprising in the following words: 

The Aim of his Uprising: 
I have not set out due to stubborness obstinacy, corruption or oppression.I have set out to reform nation of my grantrather. 
I wish to invite towards goodness and piety and refrain from sins and wrong doings and tread on the path of my father,Ali Ibne Abu Talib.(a.s).

In Ziyarat-e-Arbaeen there is also mentioned,

And he(MAULA HUSSAIN) sacrificed himself in your presence in order to save your servants from ignorance and wandering of deviation.

In short,these two expressions clearly speaks about the aim and outcome of the work of maula hussain.This analysis is based on the sayings and action of Infalliable Imams(a.s)
___________
6->Journey of Muslim Ibn Aqeel (a.s.):

In meantime, Muslim Ibn Aqeel entered Kufa amidst an expected welcome from the Kufis.. After several meetings and on being convinced of the readiness of the Kufans to assist Imam (a.s.), he wrote a letter to Imam (a.s.) inviting him to Kufa. After receiving the letter, Imam (a.s.) wrote another letter to Kufans and sent it through his emissary Qays Ibn Musahhar-e-Saydaawi.

Yazid sent his mercenaries in the guise of Hajis to assasinate Imam Husain (a.s.) so that the identity of the killers may not be known.
On the 8 of Zil Hajj, when all had gathered in Makkah for performing the Haj, Imam Husain (a.s.) converted his Haj into
Umrah and left Makkah, thereby thwarting plans of his assaination.
___________ 
7->Departure to Kufah:

Imam (a.s.) left Makkah and proceeded towards Kufa. As Imam(a.s.) was nearing Iraq, he (a.s.) received the news of a turnaround in the situation of Kufa and the martyrdom of Muslim Ibn Aqeel(a.s) by the oppressive government in Kufa. This news disheartened him and the same caused the departure of some of the people who had accompanied him for various reasons. Finally,
when Imam (a.s.) reached the junction of Kufa and Karbala, he was confronted with an army of 50,000 soldiers under the command of Hurr Ibn Yazid al-Riyaahi. He had been assigned by Ibn Ziyad, the newly appointed governor of Kufa to arrest Imam Husain (a..). Imam (a.s.) offered to reach Kufa with peace and amity or return to Madinah but he was forced to take the path to Karbala.

Karbala was the same place through which Imam (a.s.) had passed 27 years ago while proceeding to fight the Battle of Siffin and had expressed extreme sadness and lamentation at that time. Imam Husain (a.s.) descended on this place and said:

Here will be their halting place, their stopover and the place where their blood will be shed. On this ground,youths from the progeny of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) will be martyred. The heavens and the earth will cry for them.
___________
8->Arriving in Karbala:

Imam Husain (a.s.) reached the plains of Karbala in the beginning of the month of Moharram and pitched his camp. Groups of soldiers started coming towards Karbala from Kufa and Syria. The encounter between Imam Husain (a.s.) and the army of Yazid became inevitable with the arrival of Umar Ibn Saad, the commander of the Syrian force.

On the ninth Moharram, the message of Umar Ibn Saad was proclaimed to Imam (a.s.) either to accept the oath of allegiance for Yazid or be prepared for the battle. Imam (a.s.) had already made it clear that allegiance was out of question. Yazid's representatives also rejected the proposal to send away Imam (a.s.) in exile. 

Imam(a.s.) selected the option to battle it out and requested them to give a respite for a night, for worshipping and entreating to his Lord.His companions were all well disciplined and organized and they were far from any sort of hypocrisy and indiscipline.
___________
9->The Night Preceding Aashooraa:

In the camp of Imam Husain (a.s.), a strange enthusiasm was evident. Imam (a.s.) collected his companions and gave the news of impending martyrdom. He freed them of their allegiance to him and requested them to leave Karbala taking advantage of the dark night, if they so desired.By now, the fervour of his companions had reached its pinnacle and every one of them with their fiery speeches proclaimed their steadfastness and loyalty.They showed such valour on that day that their names are to be found heading the list of martyrs throughout history.After seeing this love and affection Imam (a.s.) addressed them saying:I Know of no followers more loyal and virtuous than my followers nor of any house more pious and close knit than my house.
___________
10->The Morning of Aashura:

The night passed in recitation of the Holy Quran, supplications and worship of Allah and this continued till the morning prayers.Hazrat Abul Fazl Abbas (a.s.) was the commander of the army of Imam (a.s.). He (a.s.) scaled the highest standards of love and loyalty in the battlefield on the day of Aashooraa. He bravely and steadfastly sacrificed himself in the way of Islam and Imam (a.s.) During the night, the relatives of Imam (a.s.) were heard whispering that they wished to attain martyrdom before the companions. On the other hand, the companions too were whispering that they would not allow any relative of Imam (a.s.) or anyone from the Bani Hashim to be martyred before them.In short, history does not bear evidence to the existence of such a camp whose inhabitants were desirous of obtaining martyrdom before each other. The following words of Imam Husain (a.s.) were ringing in their ears:

Behold! Do you not see that the truth has been trampled and the falsehood has been set free?

And Sentences like:Surely, l do not see in death but prosperity and happiness;and living with oppressor and tyrants but disgrace.

These words motivated and encouraged them to sacritice themselves in the way of Imam (a.s.), for enliving the truth and destroying falsehood. The penetrating and impressive personality to sacrifice of Imam (a.s.) which was reflected in sentences like:

Beware that the illegitimate one illegitimate one has given me two options: death and degradation but degradation is far away from us,

Each one of them was complete in his recognition and considered martyrdoom along with Imam (a.s.) in the way of Allah as a great success and blessing. Every one of them presented perfect models of sacrifice from the noon till the afternoon on the day of Aashooraa. 

The morning of tenth Moharram saw Janabe Hurr Ibn Yazid al-Riyaahi (a.r.) overcoming his desires and joining the army of Imam (a.s.) along with few others. Imam (a.s.) welcomed him and accepted him.It is never too late in returning to the right path. One must always be hopeful for acceptance of repentance.

Importantly we do not find great personality like ibn Abbas and Mohammed Hannifiya among the martyrs of karbala,but at the same time we find slaves and anonymous people like JAUN,GULAM-E-TURK.in the list of 72 MARTYRS. 
___________
11->The Mourning 

After the martyrdom of Imam Husain (a.s.) and his faithful companions,Janahe Zainab(s.a) and Janabe Umme Kulsoom(s.a) have granted such an eternal life to this sacrifice that inspite of all the efforts of the enemies of Ahlul bait (a.s.) to the contrary. the mourning for Imam Husain (a.s.) is observed all over the world. By the grace of the Almighty, people participating in it are increasing by the day. This mourning is the result of the narration of the events of Karbala. It is the best way of being attached to the Ahlul Bait (a.s.) and protecting the religion.Islam exists only due to this mourning.

MAY ALLAH(S.W.T) AND AHLULBAYT GRANT US ALL MOMINEEN TO DO ZIYARAT-E-KARBALA EVERY YEAR.

1->BORN: 

Imam Zainul Abeedin(a.s) was born on 15th  JAMAADIUL AWWAL 38 A.H .His mother was a persian princes bibi sheharbanu who is also referred to as Shahe Zanaan(leader of women).Maula Hussain(a.s) named him "Ali" after his respected father.At the tender age of two he was deprived of the loving care of his grandfather Imam Ali (as.). At the age of 23, he (a.s.) faced the greatest tragedy of his life i.e. the event of Karbala. Since he was his father's successor and the divine leader entrusted with the continuation of the mission of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), by the will of Allah, Imam Sajjad (a.s.) was seriously ill on the day of Aashoora. We are aware that helping the Imam of the time is such an obligatory action that which even ordinary believers are not permitted to forsake — especially if the person is from the family of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). Thus, divine will decreed sickness for Imam Sajjad (a.s.) so that divine progeny of Imams (a.s.) may be protected. It is a wrong told in history that Imam (a.s.) was always sick. 
___________
2->The Land of Karbala: 

Preserving the message of martyrdom was of utmost importance after the sacrifice of Imam Husain (a.s.). Allah decreed this responsibility be carried out by Imam Sajjad (a.s.). Imam's (a.s.) effectiveness in carrying out this task is witnessed by the popularity of this message even today. Apart from this, after Imam Husain (a.s.), since he was the only surviving male member, he (a.s.) was also entrusted with the leadership of his caravan.

The imamate of Imam Sajjad (a.s.) commenced from the noon of Aashoora, 61 A.H. in the most difficult of situations At that time he (a.s.) was suffering from high fever and had witnessed the tragic events that occurred from morning to evening of 10th Moharram. His heart was burning on seeing the merciless killings of his family members and friends one after another. At that time, the army of Yazid set to fire the tents of Imam Husain's (a.s.) camp. Being taken as prisoners, on the llth Moharram, 61 A.H. the caravan of Imam (a.s.) started its journey. 

Along with the women and children, he began this journey so that he could expose the tyrannical government of Yazid. This was the most important task of Imam (a•s.) which he continued during the remaining 34 years of his Imamate. He (a.s.) kept alive and fresh, the memories of the brave martyrs of Karbala. Had it not been for this effort of Imam (asws),The vile government of Bani Umayyah which ruled for about 70 years after the incident of Karbala would have, through its propaganda machinery and transmission, suppressed and wiped out this event from history. 
___________
3->In the Court of Syria:

With his extraordinary efforts, Imam (a.s.) gave everlasting life to this event. Imam's (a.s.) speech in the court of Yazid in Syria manifested his exalted character and spiritual superiority. Despite the fact that he had to bear mental, and physical tortures and hardships, his orations shook the very foundations of the government of Yazid. In a place like Syria (where Imam Husain (a.s.) was considered a renegade and out of the boundaries of Islam (God forbid!) due to the poisonous propaganda of Moaviyah and Yazid) such a transformation and revolution occurred that Yazid was left with no alternative but to blame the tragic event of Karbala upon the shoulders of Ibn Ziyad, his governor in Kufa. 
___________
4->Yazid disgraced: 

In the court of Yazid, before Imam Sajjad (a.s.) ascended the pulpit, Yazid ordered one of his orators to curse Imam Ali (a.s.) and Imam Husain (a.s.) and degrade their personalities. At that time Imam Sajjad (a.s.) sought permission from Yazid to address the gathering. Yazid opposed this move, but his companions insisted that Imam (a.s.) should be allowed to speak to the gathering. 'Therefore, despite the protests of Yazid, he had to relent on the demands of his companions and allowed Imam (a.s.) to ascend the pulpit.When Imam (a.s.) started his speech, Yazid said to his cronies."He has gone to the pulpit,now the only thing which will happen in defamation and disgrace for the progeny of Abu Sufyan"
___________
5->The Speech of Imam (a.s.): 

Imam (a.s.) in his comprehensive speech praised Allah and introduced his holy family. He introduced the personalities of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), Imam Ali (a.s.) and Imam Husain (a.s.) and the valuable services rendered by them in the way of Islam in a very eloquent manner. His speech had a great effect on the polluted minds of the Syrians. 

The myths regarding the government of Bani Umayyah were shattered and the true persona of Imam (a.s.) was evident for all. The speech created such an atmosphere that it provoked the people against Yazid. To defuse the tension, Yazid ordered a (MUAZZIN) to call out the AZAAN to silence Imam (a.s.). However, Imam (a.s.) after each and every sentence of Azan gave such a remarkable commentary, which resulted in increased disgrace for Yazid. In short, it was after this event that Yazid was forced to hide his face. As indicated earlier Yazid resorted to compromise and peace and ordered a mourning ceremony for Imam Husain (a.s.). After a few days he gave the order for Imam (a.s.) and all the prisoners to return to Madinah.'
___________
6->The Greatness of Imam (a.s.): 

The popularity and esteem enjoyed by the Imam (a.s.) amongst the people can be gauged from an incident during the Hajj. Hisham Ibn Abdul Malik —the Umayyad King— wanted to kiss the Hajarul Aswad (black stone) but was not successful due to the large crowd. At the same time the people were moving aside in order to give way to Imam Sajjad (a.s.) who was moving freely towards Hajarul Aswad and calmly kissed it. At that time, someone asked Hisham: "Who is this person?" Though he had recognized Imam (a.s.) he feigned ignorance about the man, he pretended and said he did not know him. At that moment, Farazdaq, a renowned poet, recited a wonderful and lengthy couplet in praise of Imam (a.s.). 
___________
7->Martyrdom: 

The love and popularity of the Imam (a.s.) amongst the people was unbearable for the Umayyad rulers and became the cause of Imam(a.s) being poisoned on the order of Waleed Ibne Abdul Malik.He was buried in the graveyard of baqi next to the grave of Maula Hasan(a.s).
___________
8->Sahifah-e-Sajjadiyah:

It is very essential to note at the end of his life history that the valuable sayings of Imam (a.s.) on various topics in Sahifah-e-Sajjadiyah should be carefully paid attention to by us. Firstly, all the supplications in this collection commence with the blessings on the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and his progeny.This opens the doors of divine mercy for the acceptance of the supplications. Imam (a.s.) in the form of supplications has discussed various topics which includes, 

1.Remembering the martyrs who were enjoining goodness. 
2.forbidding evil. 
3.guarding of Islam. 
4.protecting the frontiers of Islam.
5.supporting the truth and crushing the falsehood.
6.helping those who have no support in the society.
7.peace and security in the society, etc. 

These are springs of guidance for us.The intelligent should therefore seek guidance from it.They contain an elaborate and necessary blueprint for the principles of this life. These supplications conceal among them a comprehensive collection of Islamic teachings. Along with seeking forgiveness for sins, these supplications are the best source for purifying the self and Islamic training. A translation of these supplications is available both in Urdu and English.""",

___________
1.Born:

On Friday, the 1 of Rajab, 57 A.H., in the family of Imam Sajad (a.s.), from his wife Fatema binte hasan(daughter of Imam Hasan Mujtaba (a.s.)) in the city of Madinah, a son was born who was named Muhammad. 

This dear child who was for some time witnessed his grandfather Imam Husain (a.s.), was present in the event of Karbala, at the age of about 4 years and in his childhood witnessed the heart rending event. 

Together, with the other children he was dragged from one place to another as captive in the hnads of Yazeed's agents with the caravan, moving from Kufa to Syria. He lived for 34 years during the Imamat of his father, Imam Sajjad(a.s.) and after his demise, attained Imamat in the year 95AH. He was in charge of Shia leadership for 19 years

Years before his birth, when the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) Was talking to his famous companion, Jabir lbn Abdullah Ansari about successors, told him that the fifth of them bears my name and is from the lineage ot Husain. You, O Jabir, will also meet him. So,convey my salaam to him. Divine Destiny extended the age of jabir and at long last the foretelling of the God's Prophet (s.a.wa.) turned to reality and he conveyed the message to Imam Baqir(a.s.). Baqir literally means splitter and various sciences appeared in the time of this Imam which will be enumerated later in his life hsitory. Hence the title was given to the Imam.

This is was same title bestowed upon him by the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) long before his birth and while explaining the word to Jabir, he said:

"He will split up the knowledge of Prophets extensively" During his Imamat which was the time of the downfall of the government of Bani Umayyah - Walid Ibn Abdul Malik, Sulaiman Ibn Abdul Malik, Umar Ibn Abdul Aziz, Yazid Ibn Abdul Malik and Hisham Ibn Abdul Malik ruled over the Muslim Empire. Since many movements arose in varied parts of the Islamic society against these oppressive rulers of Bani Umayyah, the government was gradually drawn towards its downlall. As a result, most of the ruling power was utilized in silencing revolts and to a large extent the government was unable to harass Imam (a.s.). 

The event Karbala and the sensitive role played by Imam Sajjad (as) preserving its memory played an effective part in the above mentioned revolts During the 19 years of his Imamat, Imam Baqir(a.s.) took advantage of the disturbed condition of governance establishing the cultural foundation of the Shia school of thought inspite of the pressures or the previous rulers who had tried hard to wipe the traditions of the Holy Prophet (S.a.w.a.) and Imams (as) from public memory.
___________
2->The Dissemination of Knowledge:

These times became the perfect opportunity for compilation and giving shape to the foundation and principles of religion.Therefore, this was a period where comprehensive facts of the divine religion were being explained by Imam (a.s.), after a longera of intellectual and mental suffocation, created by the Umayyid and their harsh attitude towards preventing the truthful teachings of Islam.Thus, a number of students from all over the Islamic world gathered around the Imam (a.s.) in Madinah and derived benefit from his wisdom and knowledge. Jabir Ibn Yazid Ju'fi says: I have heard more than 70000 traditions from the Imam that none except him has narrated. Muhammad Tbn Muslim, a distinguished companion of Imam (a.s.) also says: Whatever problems that had arisen, I sought the opinion of Imam about them so much so that I heard over 30000 traditions from him. This resulted in the establishment of a great centre of learning in Madinah.

The present Umayyad caliphs, not unlike their predecessors, tried to create hindrances, even to the extent of ordering their governors in medina to send Imam(as) to Damascus under the custody of this activities would get curtailed.
___________
3->The Syrian Court:

On one occasion when Hisham Ibn Abdul Malik had ordered the Imam to be forcibly bought to Damascus, Imam (a.s.) entered his palace in the Islamic manner (not in official court etiquettel and after offering salaam to the audience he took a seat in a corner This obviously irked Hisham who was accustomed to a different mode of address by his sycophants. He tired to humiliate Imam(a.s.) branding his family as factors of discord and disunity, calling them false leaders. 

The sycophants too, despite the Imam's stand offered false respect to Hisham in the same un-Islamic custom. At this juncture, Imam (a.s.) objected and in the grand court of Hisham, spoke so categorically defending the dignity of the Holy household of the Prophet (s.a.w.a.), that everyone in the hall was stunned. At the end of his speech, he recited a Qur'anic verse and sarcastically reminded him that ultimate success and victory for the pious ones.Upon this, Hisham ordered the imprisonment of Imam (a.s.).

In the prison the other imamates gathered around him devoutedly.When Hisham realised that he,by his own hands had created another centre of revolution,had no other choice to release  Imam(a.s) and send him back to Madinah honourably.

Therefore,whenever the occasion permitted,and when they saw that the islamic basics where in danger and when an Un-Islamic elements like the Umayyad Caliphs intended to degrade the great personalities,the Imam(a.s) spokes out courageously and fearlessly.
___________
4->Imparting Knowledge:

Imam (a.s.) played a profound role in laying the foundation of classes for teaching Islam, giving shape to the school of thought and putting down in writing the basics of Islamic culture. This path and method was also adopted by his honourable son. Islamic sciences developed and spread a great deal during this period. Young students of Imam (a.s.) gained universal fame in the vast Islamic territories. Today, Shia texts are full of explanations given by Imam Baqir (a.s.). The Imam (a.s.) initiated the way for countering the misleading philosophical concepts that were adopting Islamic colour. 
___________
5->Martyrdom:

Finally on Monday, the 7th of Zilhijj in the year 114 A.H., Imam (a.s.) was poisoned on the direction of Ibrahim Ibn Walid Ibn Abdul Malik and he departed from this world at the age of 57. He, like is father and ancestor (Imam Hasan (a.s.)) was buried in the Baqi graveyard. Even today, his grave, next to the shrine of his father, his ancestor and children in the Baqi cemetery, is the shrine for thousands of devotees of monotheism, justice and knowledge. A glance upon the history of Imam Baqir (a.s.) may be brought to conclusion with the mention of two of his invaluable sayings in the field of knowledge and justice."""

11-KILLER NAME: MANSUR DAWAANKI(L.A).
___________
1->Birth:

On Friday,the 17th Rabiul Awwal,83 A.H,in the house of Maula Baqir from his wife Bibi Umme farwa,a son was born name Jafar.

Much Before this birth,when the Almighty ALLAH had informed his Prophet about his 12 Successors,this child(who was later called Maula Jaffar-e-Sadiq) Known by agnomen as Abu Abdillah and who took charge of the guardianship of the society after his father was remembered.
___________
2->Caliphs of his Time:

Imam (a.s.) passed his childhood during the period of his father and magnanimous grandfather. With the martyrdom of Imam Baqir (a.s.) in 114 A.H., he ascended to the Imamat and divine caliphate at the age of 31 years. 

The period of this Imam closely resembled that of his father Baqir (a.s.) because the revolutionary activities against the Umayyid rule had intensified and the final of the dynastic links was breathing its last years of rule. 

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) was contemporary to five Umayyid caliphs and two caliphs of Bani Abbas. They are Hisham Ibn Abdul Malik, Walid Ibn Yazid Ibn Abdul Malik, Yazid Ibn Walid Ibn Abdul Malik. Ibrahim Ibn Walid and Marwan Ibn Muhammad (these 5 were Umayyid caliphs. The last was notorious in history as Marwane Himaar. (Himaar means donkey) With his assassination, the Umayyid dynasty came to an end).Saffah and Mansoor Dawanqi were the other two caliphs who belonged to Bani Abbas.
___________
3->Propogation of Islam:

The resemblance of the periods of Imam Sadiq (a.s.) and Imam Baqir (a.s.) was the reason for Imam Sadiq (a.s.) in adopting and continuing the precedent set by his father in the spread of Islamic teachings and culture. According to most historians, this progressed to an extent where 4000 pupils participated in his classes in Madinah for learning diversified sciences.
___________
4->Students of Maula jaffar-e-sadiq (a.s.):

Among his students were world famous personalities like Zurarah, Muhammad Ibn Muslim, Hisham Ibn Hakam, Abaan Ibn Taghlib and Jabir Ibn Hayyaan. Even some of the top Sunni leaders were among those had gained knowledge in this school. In this regard, mention may be made of Sufyaan Soori, Abu Hanifa (the spiritual head of the Hanafi sect when is the main branch of Sunnis), Qazi Sukooni and Qazi Abul Bakhtari. These are the famous words of Abu Hanifa: 

[If those two years (referring to the time when he obtained training from Imam Sadiq (a.s.)) had not been there,No'man would have been destroyed. 
___________
5->The True Religion:

Since the Shias have come to be known as Ja'fari and the sect is introduced as headed by Imam Sadiq (a.s.), it is necessary to give clarification in this respect. At times, due to misinterpretation of history, some people think the Shias are in the same rank as the four Sunni sects and Imam Ja'far Sadiq (a.s.) is a personality like . Abu Hanifa, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Malik Ibn Anas and Shafeii.Some simpletons who wish to turn towards unification of Islam and return to the pristine religion express that we should return to the same religion that prevailed during the time of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), when there was no origin of these five persons. This is a totally wrong and absurd idea. The Shias do not believe that a new sect (other than Islam) has been invented in the second century Hijri, entrusting the leadership to Imam Ja'far Sadiq (a.s.). 

This may be more applicable to the Sunnis whose leaders did not see the initial period of Islam and their jurisprudence was formulated with a gap of more than a century. The term `shia' has its roots from the era of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) as is evident in history while the other sects are devoid of this excellence (which proves their wrong path of understanding religion). In order to present evidence for this claim, we produce just one of numerous examples, in this lesson. Jalaaluddin Suyuti, a reputed Sunni scholar has authored a famous commentary by the name of Al-Durrul Manthoor wherein he discusses this verse of the Noble Qur'an: 

Surely those who believe and do good,they are the best of men.]-SURAH BAYYINAH(98):Verse 7
___________
6->Shias and Islam:

The fact is that Shiaism is the true method and path of Islam. Our leaders after the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) are the personalities who sourced knowledge from that divine spring only and have been performing the duties of leadership after the Prophet(s.a.w.a.)'s demise till date. Imam Sadiq (a.s.) has been the source of the greatest services to Islam during his 34 years of Imamat. 

It is crystal clear that if his tremendous and exhaustive collection of sayings and guidelines in diverse fields of religion and society did not exist, Islam would not enjoy the universality and comprehensiveness which it does today. The treasure house of sciences and facts would have remained undisclosed.Today, in the world of jurisprudence, Fiqhe Ja'fari is viewed as the most accurate basis of law. 
___________
7->His Worship: 

Imam Sadiq (a.s.), like his forefathers, was a mine of excellences. He had such depth in worship that Maalik Ibn Anas, Imam of the Malikis (one of the four Sunni sects) says:

I would generally observe him in one of these three conditions: 

1.Either offering prayers (namaz). 

2.Observing fast

3.Reciting the Holy Qur'an.
___________
8->The Importance of Namaz:

He was so firm in the worship of Allah that even on his death bed, while breathing his last, he called in his near ones and addressed them thus: 

Surely,he will not reach our intercession,the one who takes (NAMAZ) Lightly.

[AL KAAFI VOL-E,PG-270].
___________
9->Training of Preachers:

Among the importants works of Imam(a.s) was the training of a number of hsi experience students for discussions and debate with the leaders of different sects and religion.At the top of the lists was Maulas famous young companion by the name of Hisham Ibn Hakam. In this way, the light of Islam became evident on one hand and on the other, the deviation that others intended to spread and propagate was dealt with. These students would first learn the method of debate and argument from Imam (a.s.). After every debate they would normally report to Imam (a.s.) so that probable defects could be rectified. Their presence in the company of Imam (a.s.) and observation of his specific debates with the scholars and believers of other religions too was a significant factor in their learning of this important task. The Imam (a.s.) never faced a particular group only in such discussions. Rather, he would discuss and debate with different groups such as unbelievers, polytheists, atheists, fatalists and the Tafwizi (who believe God has no control left). But since the students did not possess the comprehensiveness of knowledge of Imam (a.s.), hence depending upon their interest and talent, they would each specialize in a particular field. 
___________
10->Martyrdom: 

The Abbasid Caliphs took the reins from the Umayyid. After gaining control over the people, they adopted a similar method and policy as the Umayyid but with greater harshness towards the household of the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and their Shia followers. Particularly, during the rule of Mansoor, a strict watch was maintained on Imam (a.s.) who was forcibly called from Madinah to the administrative headquarters several times.On numerous occasions, Mansoor also ordered the assassination of Imam (a.s.). But his majestic presence and his personality created such awe in Mansoor that he gave up the idea. But, his jealousy of the Imam (as.) increased exponentially due to Imam's (a.s.) knowledge, social and Islamic stature. He finally ordered that Imam (as.) be poisoned. Imam (a.s.) was martyred by the poison given by Muhammad Ibn Sulaiman, Mansoor's governor in Madinah on 15th Rajab in the year 148 Hijri at the age of 65 years. He was laid to rest in the graveyard of Baqi besides the other three Imams (a.s.). 

11->Lessons from His Life:

Imam Sadiq's (a.s.) Imamat lasted a period of 34 years during which he trained his Shias to overcome adversities in reaching one's goal. He also showed that no movement or campaign could survive unless it bears cultural roots and depth. Hence, every opportunity must be utilized in making the movement deep rooted.

Imam (a.s.), in his Imamat, made the Shia Islam so rich with the basics and established such scientific and cultural roots that 14 centuries of attacks against this religion with the Shias in minority and all the restrictions upon its leaders have not been able to eradicate it. Rather, day by day, these circumstances themselves have been effective in the exaltation of Islam and Shiaism.""",

___________    

As mentioned in the previous masoom life history,the Abbasids followed a part similar to the Ummayids or even worse.The very people who Played a major role in overthrowing the Bani Umayyah and fought in support of the Bani Abbas were regretting their decision.The new caliphs began oppressing the divine leaders of Islam (a.s.)) with greater intensity. During his life (the Holy Imams!the Imam Kazim (a.s.) witnessed the reign of four caliphs na line; Mansoor, Mohammad Mandi, Moosa al-Hadi and Haroon Rashid. He He faced a lot of suffering because of them and passed a large part  of his life in the prisons of Muhammad Mandi. Moreover, he remained in the prisons of Basra and Baghdad on the orders of Haroon Rashid, the powerful and pleasure seeking Abbasid caliph. Nonetheless, during the 35 years of his Imamat, Imam (a.s.) was under severe control and watch of government 

1->Love for Imam (a.s.):

The matter which increased the jealousy of the Abbasid caliphs, particularly Haroon towards Imam (a.s.) was the great love, affection and reputation he enjoyed among the different groups of people in the society. The caliphs observed that their pomp and position did nothing in winning over the people not realizing that this affection  of the people towards Imam (a.s.) was a divine endownment.
___________
2->Worship in Prison:

A study of Imam's (a.s.) manner and conduct in prison teaches us valuable lessons. Imam (a.s.) utilized this opportunity in uplifting his soul through worship of Allah in such way that it astonished everyone. Fazl Ibn Rabi, one of the jailers, has described the period of Imam's (a.s.) confinement in his own words which is recorded in the book `Aayaan al-Shia'. He speaks about the magnificence of his spirit and his profound inclination in prayers and prostration before the Almighty Allah. 

This fact is also reflected in the statement of the sister of Sendi Ibn Shahek the last jailor of Imam (a.s.). So impressed was she by the spiritual stat and the worship of Imam (a.s.) that she would repeatedly say: 

What a loser is the community that stretches its atrocious and cruel hands towards this great man.

3->Martydom:

Finally on Friday the 25th Rajab in the year 183 A.H.he bid farewell to the world on account of the poison given by Sendi Ibn Shahek in the Baghdad jail at the behest of Haroon leaving behind the Shias and lovers of truth and freedom in tears,grief and sorrow.""",

11-KILLER NAME: MAMOON RASHEED(L.A).
___________
1->Born:

On Thursday, the 11h of Zilqad, 148 A.H., a child was born in the house of Imam Musa al-Kazim (a.s.) by his wife Tahirah, in Madinah. He was named Ali. His childhood and youth was spent under the guardianship of his great and noble father, who was the inheritor of the holy status of Imamat.He became Imam on the demise of his pious father in the year 183A.H. and started looking after the affairs of the Shias. Imam Ali Ibn Musa (a.s.) (popularly known by his title Reza) faced the reign of three Abbasid caliphs in his Imamat of 20 years. Ten years of Haroon as caliph, five of Ameen and five years of Mamoon.The period of his Imamat can be divided into three distinct parts.
___________
2->First Period:

During the Caliphate of Haroon for ten years, the conditions created for Imam (a.s.) after the martyrdom of Imam Musa al-Kazim (a.s.) were similar to those conditions prevailing for Imam Zainul Aabedeen (a.s.) after the event of Aashoora. During this period, the government of Haroon had increased its vigilance on Imam (a.s.). The Shias of Imam (a.s.) were' also put to intense surveillance by the ruler.For instance, Haroon ordered to Humaid Ibn Qahtaba, one of his agents to behead sixty Shias in a single night. It was during this period that Imam Reza's (a.s.) brother Abdullah Aftas was imprisoned.
___________
3->Second Period:

This period was of eight years, i.e., after the death of Haroon till the acceptance of Imam (a.s.) as Mamoon's heir apparent. This period is similar to that of the 5th and 6th Imams (a.s.). During this time, there were uprisings in every corner of the Islamic empire which greatly perturbed the ruling party in addition to the power struggle between Ameen and Mamoon. Imam (a.s.) was provided Some freedom.From among the most important revolts of Alaw Sadat, was that of Muhammad-e-Deebai in Madinah, Muhammad Tbn Ibrahim and Abul Saraya. They revolted against the tyrannical government of the Abbasids. These reflected the shaky position of the Abbasid rule and the strength of the opposition.
___________
4->Third Period
The period as heir apparent of Imam Reza (a.s.) lasted for 18 months from the time of the acceptance of Mamoon's proposal for the post till the martyrdom of Imam (a.s.).This period was full of varied difficulties and we will elaborate on it in due course.After the period of hardships and restrictions of Haroon, Imam(a.s.) got enough time to further the works done by his predecessors, Imam Baqir (a.s.) and Imam Sadiq (a.s.). He strived to divulge the truths of Islam. Ample traditions on various topics related by Imam (a.s.) are still found in books showing his efforts in this regard. Ultimately, Mamoon killed his brother Ameen and hung the severed head on the door of his palace. 

He then awarded prizes to his army officers in front of it for killing his own brother.After this incident, Mamoon felt that the worst danger was from the followers of Imam Ali (a.s.).)
___________
5->REALIZATION OF MAMOON & MAULA REZA MARTYDOM:

Soon the aides of Mamoon realized that he had lailed once again and the divine knowledge of Imam (a.s.) became more evident than before. Another incident of this period served a severe blow to Mamoon. In order to show that he was on good terms with Imam(a.s.), it was suggested to lead Eidul Fitr prayers. Initially Imam(a.s.) refused. But, when Mamoon insisted, Imam (a.s.) accepted with the condition that he should be allowed to go to the place of prayer as Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) used to go. Imam (a.s.) came out of the house dressed in white and while reciting takbeer, he proceeded outside the city. On the way, Muslims joined this gathering in groups and the cry 'Allahu Akbar' resounded in every nook and corner. 

The advisers of Mamoon warned him to think of a remedy quickly for it was likely that after the prayers and sermon of Imam (a.s.), there could be public discontent and uprising against his tyrannical government. Mamoon tactfully called Imam(a.s.) back from halfway. This incident took place in the month of Shawwal 202 A.H. Mamoon became insecure and frightened seeing that he was committing harakiri and he gradually came to the conclusion to kill Imam (a.s.). On the 17" day of Safar, 203 Hijri, he poisoned Imam Reza (a.s.) and left a permanent shameful stain of pure blood on his clothes by this cowardly act.

Even in his last hours, Imam (a.s.) looked after his near ones.When he saw that his servants and companions had not eaten food and were lamenting his serious illness (due to the poison), he ordered his servant Yaseer to serve food and with great difficulty he himself sat besides his companions. Moreover, he ordered that women should also be served with food separately. It was after this serving of food that Imam (a.s.) fainted, fell on one side and expired.
___________
6->LOVE OF IMAM TOWARDS PEOPLE:
In order to know about the affection of Imam (a.s.) towards worship, it is not out of place to mention this incident. Imam (a.s.)sent a gift to one of the Shia poets of the time, viz, Debel Khuzaai.This gift was a cloak made of fur which he himself had worn.Imam (a.s.) gifted this cloak to him since in this dress, Imam (a.s.)had prayed for a thousand nights and in each night a thousand rak'at namaz and finished reciting the Qur'an for a thousand times.""",

Imam Taqi (a.s.) was born on the eve of Friday, 10th of Rajab 195 A.H. His mother's name was Sabika. He spent his first 8 years with his holy father, Imam Reza (a.s.). In 203 A.H. after the Martyrdom of Imam Reza(a.s.)he succeeded him as the Imam. His agnomen (Kuniyyat) was Abu Jafar.

The concern of the Imam being a minor had never appeared earlier in the chain of Imamate. Hence this became an issue for the first time in the case of Imam Taqi (a.s.). On one hand, there was a group of people who questioned how  Allah, the Almighty could Grant the exalted status of Imamate to a young child and hand over the reins of guidance of the community to him. We can realise this matter by observing the questions which were raised about the Imam (a.s.) during his father's time. During the period of Imam Ali Reza (a.s.), those who were enquiring about his Imamate at a young age were told to consider and study the appointment of Isa (a.s.) who was raised to the position of Prophethood while he was still in the cradle. Imam Ali Reza (a.s.) indicated this fact in a simple sentence saying,

["We are a family in which our young inherit each and everything from their elders. "]

On the other hand, Mamoon who suffered heavy defeats in confronting the learned personality of Imam Reza (a.s.) thought that after his martyrdom, there would be no further obstacles in his path. When the message of the Imamate of Imam Taqi (a.s.) Teached him, considering the young age of the new Imam (a.s.), he considered repeating his wicked plan (which he had carried out against Imam Reza (a.s.) to crush the holy personality of Imam Taqi (a.s.). However history witnessed how Mamoon had to face disgrace in his plans yet again. Mamoon organised for group discussions and debates by calling known scholars of the era such as Yahya Ibn Aktham and instigated them to pose difficult questions to Imam (a.s.). But when these scholars were confronted by the Imam (a.s.) regarding their own questions and the various facets thereof, they were bewildered and left the gathering with their heads hanging in shame.

When Yahya Ibn Aktham was the Chief Justice, he, on Mamoon's instructions, sought the opinion of the Imam (a.s.) about a person who hunts while in the state of Ehram. Imam (a.s.) while explaining the eleven aspects of this question, asked him as to which aspect he wanted. On hearing this, Yahya Ibn Aktham was stunned. In a state of visible discomfort, his helplessness was obvious to all. After everybody had left, Mamoon requested Imam (a.s.) to answer the question from all the aspects and the same was done by the Imam (a.s.) in great detail.Many such incidents had made Mamoon's ego bite the dust.Imam's tremendous knowledge had made such an impression on Mamoon's mind that whenever anyone would speak ill of Imam (a.s.) for any reason and bring forward the matter of the young age of the Imam (a.s.) as an excuse, Mamoon would rebuke them saying, "He is more knowledgeable than any of you and more acquainted with the Shariat of Alah and the Sunnah of the Prophet than you. He is better versed than all of you about the Quran. If you desire you can test him, and if you find him as I have described, then accept my word."

In order to keep a close eye on Imam (a.s.), despite stiff opposition of his advisors, Mamoon gave the hand of his daughter Ummul Fazl to him so that he may be aware of the activities in Imam's (a.s.) house. Thus, despite lack of any apparent external pressure, Imam (a.s.) was kept under strict surveillance. The uneasiness that  Imam(a.s) experienced from the forceful living can be observed from his statements.Once while replying to a questions from one of his companions,Abu Talib-e-Qummi,

Imam(a.s) Wrote,"Write an elegy for my father as well as for me".This revels that behind the veil of an apparently independent life,Imam(a.s) was living under strict observation and affliction and desired that his companion should write elegies to spread the news of his captivity in the society.

In The 17 years of imamate,Imam saw the reigns of two rulers of Bani Abbas-Mamoun and Motasim.During the reign of Motasim,Imam(a.s) was forcibly brought from Madinah to Baghdad in Muharram 220 A.H.Desoite all the restriction Imam Fulfilled all his responsiblity in best possible way.

2->Martydom:

Ultimately on Saturday, the last day of the month of Zilqad, 220 A.H. on the command of Mo'tasim, Imam (a.s.) was poisoned by his wife Ummul Fazl (daughter of Mamoon — perhaps, it was for this reason that Mamoon had married his daughter to Imam (a.s.)) which led to his martyrdom at the age of 25 years. 

He was buried next to the grave of his grand father Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.). This area was later known as Kazmain and even today it remains the centre of attraction for thousands of followers of Imams (a.s.).""",

1->Born:

Maula Ali Naqi was born in the second half of Zilhajj 212 A.H. in a suburb of Madinah called 'Surya', in the house of Imam Mohammad Taqi (a.s.) and 'Samaana'. He was named Ali' like three of his ancestors.In 220 AH, after the martyrdom of Imam Mohammad Taqi (a.s.), the responsibility of Imamate came upon the young Imam who was, at that time, only eight years old.Of his several titles 'Hadi' and 'Naqi' are the most popular. Generally, he is remembered more as Imam Ali Naqi and Imam Hadi. His Kuniyyat is 'Abul Hasan’. 
___________
2->Caliphs during his Era 

During the 34 years of his life, Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.) passed through six caliphs of Bani Abbas, namely Mo'tasim, Waathiq, Mutawakkil, Muntasir, Mustaeen and Mo'taz. All six of them followed the footsteps of their fathers and tried to create as much difficulties for Imam (a.s.) as possible.Amongst the calamities that Imam (a.s.) faced, was the deportation of the Prophet's (s.a.w.a.) progeny from Madinah to Saamarra (which was the capital of Muslim rule). This deportation took place during Mutawakkil's reign. After this deportation. there was a significant increase in the injustice and tortures afflicted on the Imams (a.s.) by the Umayyad and Abbasside caliphs and their agents. These injustices were done under the direct supervision of the Caliph. 

Mutawakkil's agents had reported from Makkah and Madinah that if you want these two cities, then deport Imam (a.s.) from here.On account of this and due to other factors, Mutawakkil took this step. Mutawakkil's desperation becomes more evident when we see how he placed Imam (a.s.) in a military cantonment ('Askar'). Imam (a.s.) passed more than 20 years of his life in this 'prison'.Thus, the government kept an eye on each and every contact and meeting of Imam (a.s.). 

Not satisfied with this, based on the reports of his spies and sycophants, the government often raided the house of the Imam (a.s.) unannounced, alleging that he was gathering arms and mobilising his friends for attempting a rebellion against the government. Under this excuse, every nook and corner of the Imam's (a.s.) house was searched.This aspect of Imam's (a.s.) life highlights that the tyrannical Abbasside government was under tremendous stress and also brings forth the extent of the fear of the Ahle Bait (a.s.) in the hearts of the rulers.The ability to lead society, profound knowledge, piety, righteousness and awareness was abundant in our Imams (a.s.). The society and members of the ruling government were well aware of this fact.Hazrat Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.) was raised to the status of Imamate at the age of eight.
___________
3->His Supplications

Invocations have also been noted from Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.) in which every prayer has a world of understanding in its lap.Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.) enjoys such a status in the history of Islam that the greatest scholars of Ahle Sunnat have mentioned him in their writings. Ibn Khallekaan in Wafayaatul A'yaan, volume 2, page 435; Mohammad Ibn Talha Shafaei in Mataalebus So'I, page 188; Ibn Hajar Haithami in al-Sawaaeq al-Mohreqah, page 205. 

Each one of them has remembered Imam (a.s.) in their books and in various ways mentioned his greatness.
___________
4->His Martydom

Finally, on the command of Moa' taz Abbasi, Imam (a.s.) was poisoned and martyred on Monday, 3rd Rajab 254 A.H. at the age of 42 years.

His martyrdom worsened the image of the Abbasids His holy body was buried in his house in Saamarra. Today visitors from every nook and corner come to his grave and through his holy self try to gain proximity with Allah the Almighty. To end this lesson, we quote an extract from the invocation of Imam (a.s.) which he used to recite in Qunoot. This invocation to some extent conveys those heart rending problems which Imam (a.s.) had faced in his 34 years of Imamate.""",

1->Born and Bought Up:

Imam Hasan Askari (a.s.) was born on the 8th of Rabi us Thaani, 232 AH in Madinah. His mother's name was 'Saleel. His Kuniyyat was Abu Mohammad. His moral, spiritual and physical characteristics are mentioned in historical books, greatly emphasizing on his majesty and grandeur. After the martyrdom of his father in 254 A.H., he took the reins of the nation's affairs in his hand at the age of 22. He spent the six years of his Imamate with three Abbasside caliphs, Mo'taz, Mohtadi and Motamid.He spent his entire life under severe pressure of the government  know the reason behind his title "Askari', it should be remembered as mentioned in the lesson of Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.) that they were forcibly kept in a military cantonnent (Askar) in Saamarra.The Imam spent most of the time of his Imamate in this area under strict government Vigilance and hence the title of Askariwas given to him

It will suffice to know that the main reason for the unlimited harassment of Government towards the Imam (a.s.) was to a great extent directly related to the matter of belief of the people that the real avenger and the one who will return the right of the innocent and oppressed from the oppressors.Imam Mahdi Hujat Ibnil Hasan (a.s) will be from his progeny. The Abbasids were certain of this prophecy because of their true reporters and intormers. Therefore they made every attempt that the child should not come into this world at all.

Due to these restrictions, Imam (a.s.) had appointed his representatives for the ease of his followers so that through them people could solve their problems and connect with Imam (a.s.). These representatives were bearers of great personalities and were highly respected amongst the Shias. Amongst these representatives were Uthman Ibn Saeed Amri and his son Mohammad Ibn Uthman.

The life history of Imam (a.s.) notes that he was always kept under the surveillance of hard hearted and tyrannical jailors. Amongst this evil group we also find the name of Saleh Ibn Waseef. In the past, the Abbasids made every attempt in destroying the manifested unity of the Shiahs. Often the tomb of Imam Husain (a.s.) which was a centre to keep alive the spirit of Imam Husain's (a.s.) revolution and a factor for inspiring the Shiahs towards a struggle and striving was flooded with water (as was done at the time of Mutawakkil).At other times, they used to block the path of eager visitors to Imam (a.s.) and also give orders for destroying the of Imam (a.s.). Many a times they also used to manifest military strength and superficial power in order to create a threat in the hearts of Shiahs (like the march of 90,000 well-equipped soldiers in Saamarra in front of Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.).

A lot  has been said about the spiritual, moral and Islamic characteristics of mam (a.s.), some of which are recorded in the in the pages of history. He had no parallel in worship and piety, so much so that when two of the most wicked agents of Saleh Ibn Waseef the jailor of Imam (a.s.) were forced by the Abbasids to be more severe with Imam (a.s.), they would describe him in the following words, "What do you say about such a great man who fasts during the day and worships Allah during the night. He does not speak much and does not engage himself except in worship and obedience. When he looks at us, we begin to tremble involuntarily (a trembling due to the magnificence of Imam (a.s.),and his fear sinks deep down into our heart."

In order to circumvent the severe restrictions of the government, Imam (a.s.) placed a great emphasis on Taqaiyyah.' This was done in order to reduce the government pressure as also to ensure that Shias enjoy a better existence and create a centre for Shiahs. He used to command his companions like Dawood Ibn Aswad not to be so offensive towards the detractors of Imam (a.s.) and to continue his own work.This matter advises us that Shias should determine their own course in the society in accordance with the needs prevailing in the society so that maximum results are achieved with minimum resources and that they should not unnecessarily take superficial steps which are in fact hindrances. Perhaps the reason for the scattering of the famous companions of lmam (a.s.) in different corners (like Abu Ali Ahmed lbn Ishaq Ashari in Qum and Abu Sahl Ismail Naubakhti in Baghdad) and remaining far from him during this period was due to the fact that they were working under the cover of Taqaiyyah and at the same time were spreading the Shiah culture.Amongst the most important works left behind from Imam Hasan Askari (a.s.) is a Tafseer on Holy Qur'an which has been published several times over the years 1268 A.H. to 1315 A.H. and is available at present. His method of explanation of the verses of Qur'an was adopted and followed to a great extent by famous Shiah scholars like Shaikh Saduq (r.a.), Shaikh Tabrisi (r.a.) and Allamah Majlisi (r.a.).The valuable sayings and advices of Imam (a.s.) which are in our hands are an illuminator of the path to be adopted by the followers.

Regarding the general behaviour of Shiahs he says,

1.Be an ornament for us 

2."Be careful (of your duty) towards Allah, Be an ornament for us and do not be a disgrace for us. Attract the love of others towards us and repel the evils (which attack the belief in us) away from us."

Mustadrak al-Wasaael, vol. 8, p. 314, Ch. 1, H. 9531
___________
2.LAST STAGE OF HIS(A.S.W.S) LIFE.

The period of six years of Hazrat's lnmamate ended and the people inspite of all the difficulties benefitted as much as they could from him. Ultimately on the command of Mo'tamid Abbasi, Imam (a.s.) was poisoned at the age of 28 years. The poison delayed its effect and gradually Imam's (a.s.) health began to decline and he fell seriously ill.When Mo'tamid heard of this, he sent his special servant Nehree-e-Khadim along with his other agents to serve him and appointed a doctor to look after him. When his fast declining health led Imam (a.s.)  towards death, Mo'tamid ordered the Qazaelul Qozaat (Chief Justice ) to go to Imam's (a.s.) bedside with famous and known scholars and ordered them to prepare and sign false testimonies stating that Imam (a.s.) had died a natural death. This act itself proves how much the powerful Abbasids were fearful of the hidden Shiah strength that they had to play such a fraud on the people.

Thus, on 8th Rabiul Awwal, 260 A.H., Imam (a.s.) was martyred. On the caliph's order, the house of Imam (a.s.) was searched by his agents in order to verify that he had not left behind a son. Allah put a veil on their eyes and they could see nothing. Therefore, they pushed Ja'far, the brother of Imam Hasan Askari (a.s.) and accorded him apparent respect to show that the chain of Imamate was over and that expectations of the society (that Imam (a.s.) Mahdi would destroy all the oppressive governments) will not become a reality. In 260 A.H.,with the martyrdom of Imam hasan Askari(a.s),the Imamate or leadership of the community took a new turn which will be shown inn his Sons Life History.""",

1->Birth of Imam Mahdi(atfs):

Janab Hakimah Khatoon (s.a) was the guest of Imam Hasan al- Askari (a.s.). When she was ready to leave for her house, Imam (a.s.) told her, "Please stay back in my house tonight because a son will be born to me who is revered in the eyes of Allah and who will enliven the earth after its death." Janab Hakimah (a.r.) enquired about the mother of this child. He (a.s.) replied, "Narjis." Janab Hakimah (a.r.) agreed to the request. But when she saw Janab Narjis (a.r.), to her utter amazement, there were no signs of pregnancy. She came back to Imam Hasan al-Askari (a.s.) and expressed her surprise. Imam (a.s.) smiled and said,

•The signs of pregnancy shall appear at dawn because Narjis is similar to the mother of Hazrat Moosa (a.s.). None was aware of his birth and the signs of pregnancy appeared only at the exact moment of birth of the child. For, Firaon used to tear apart the wombs of the pregnant women to prevent the birth of Hazrat Moosa (a.s.). This son resembles Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) in this aspect.

Kamaaluddin by Shaikh Saduq (a.r.), chapter 42, Shawaahedun Nobuwwah by Abdur Rehmaan Jaami

After midnight, Hakimah Khatoon (a.r.) stood up to perform her night-vigil prayers. Dawn was near. She saw Janab Narjis (s.a.) fast asleep and observed no signs of pregnancy in her. At this moment, doubts began to invade her mind when suddenly the silence was broken by Imam Hasan al-Askari (a.s.)'s voice, "Aunt! Don't be in haste. The appointed hour is near." Janab Hakimah (a.r.) felt ashanmed of her thought, albeit transient, and she began reciting the Holy Quran. Hardly any time had passed, when Janab Narjis (s.a.) suddenly got up from her slumber, performed wuzu and the night-vigil prayers. The dawn was cleaving apart the night. She felt the labour pains at the time of Azaan, and in a few seconds, the proof of Allah and the promise of the Prophets (a.s.) {who will fulfil the divine promise in the entire universe), viz. Hazrat Hujjat Ibn al-Hasan al-Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) was born.
___________
2->Necessity of Imam Mahdi’s (a.t.f.s.) Recognition:

The Holy Quran declares.

•On the day when We shall call every nation with their Imam (leader).

Surah Bani Israel (17); verse 71

Every wise person is aware of the fact that it is obligatory to recognise Allah and His Prophets (a.s.). Besides believing in Allah and His emissaries (a.s.). it is also necessary that everybody must know the Imam of his time and believe in his lmamat. That is after Divine Monetheism and Pruphethood it is compulsory for everybody to believe in lmamat and hence the call for recognition. The importance of Imam ‘s (a.s.) recognition is underlined by the following tradition of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) which is narrated by both Shia as well as Sunni traditionalists.

•One who dies without recognising the imam of his time time, dies the death of jaahiliivyah (ignorance).

Musnad 0f Ahmad lbn Hanbal, 2/73; Saheeh Bukhari, 5/17; Saheeh Muslim. trad. No. 1849; Al-Kaﬁ of Kulayni (r.a.), 1/377; Kamaaluddeen of Shaykh Sadooq (r.a.), ch. 39, pg. 4l0, 411


Jaahiliivyah is the period before Islam when only deviation prevailed. If somebody believes in Tauheed, Prophethood, Qiyamat, Quran and Islam and also fulﬁls his religious obligations but lacks only one thing, i.e. he does not recognize the Imam of his time and dies in this very condition, indeed his death is that of disbelief and ignorance. If one really intends to take advantage of Tauheed, Qiyamat and all other beliefs and actions, it is essential that he acquires the recognition of the Imam of his time.

Therefore, if the people of Imam Sadeq’s (as) era did not recognize him, their religion would be ﬂawed. Similarly, in today ‘s time, it is necessary to recognize the Imam of the time, viz. Hazrat Mahdi (a.t.f.s.). If somebody does not possess the Imam ‘s recognition, indeed his religion is incomplete. In other words,along with subscription to the belief in Tauheed, Qiyamat and other lmams (as), it is necessary for all of us to recognize the Imam of our time and to believe in him.

During his historic journey to Neyshaapoor, Imam Reza (a.s.) received a hearty welcome from the people and the scholars of the Ahle Sunnat. who insisted him to relate some traditions. Imam Reza (a.s.) narrated this tradition for them on the authority of his ancestors, extending till the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), that Allah the Almighty, says

The statement, there is no god but Allah, is My Fort, and the one who enters My Fort is saved from My Chastisement.

On hearing this, the Ahle Sunnat scholars were delighted and made way for the Imam (a.s.). Then, he raised his head from the cubicle and elaborated this Hadith-e-Qudsi thus,

(This belief in Tauheed) has some conditions. And I (i.e. the belief in my Imamat) am one of the conditions.

•Oyoon-o-Akhbaar al-Reza (a.s.), chap. 37, vol. 4, pg. 134, Trad. 4

Thus, in the present era, to complete our faith and to protect ourselves from eternal chastisement, it is necessary that we believe in the lmamat of Hazrat Mahdi (a.t.f.s.). This treatise has been arranged to facilitate recognition concerning Imam (a.s.). It is our aim to provide important cognition in the light of the Holy Quran and traditions and to answer the common questions on this topic.

We hope that the Almighty Allah illuminates our hearts with the recognition of the holy Ahle Bait (a.s.) and Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) and may we die with these correct beliefs. Aameen!
___________    
2->Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) in the light of the Holy Quran and other heavenly scriptures:

•And indeed We have written in the Psalms after the Old Testament that My righteous servants shall inherit the earth.

Surah Anbiya (21); Verse 105

•All the Shia commentators and some Ahle Sunnat interpreters are of the opinion that the phrase ‘My righteous servants ‘in this verse implies Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.).

Eqdud Durar by Sullami Shafe‘ei. pg. 2l7

This explains that the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a,t.f.s.) and his universal government have been discussed in the Psalms (Zaboor) and other divine books. The nations of the previous Prophets (as) were also aware of this tact. It is significant to note that such glad tidings are available in these scriptures despite their distortions.

(For details one can refer "Nejaatbakhshi wa Adyaan by Mohammad Taqi Muhassal).

When other heavenly books contain the discussion of Hazrat Mahdi ‘s (a.t.f.s) reappearance, then is it possible that the Holy Quran will be devoid of it ‘? Certainly not! In fact, the Majestic Quran has discussed about it, time and again. Renowned traditionalist. Sayed Hashim Bahraani (r.a.), in his book “Al- Muhajjah fi ma nazala fil Qaaemil Hujjah" has mentioned 120 verses revealed regarding Hazrat Mahdi (a.t.f.s.). Besides, there are other verses that have not been mentioned in these books.

•Contemporary researchers have counted the number of verses to be around 265.

Refer ‘Mojam al-Ahaadees alilmam al-Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) by Shaykh Ali Kuraai. vol. 5

Relating these verses Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) is not conﬁned only to the Shias. Rather, even celebrated Sunni scholars and interpreters have deemed them thus. We shall cite just one Sunni scholar as an instance. Shaykh Sulayman Qundoozi Hanafi was a great scholar from Turkey in the thirteenth century. He has written a book named “Yanaabeeul Mawaddah". In its third volume, he has devoted the 71 st chapter to the verses of the Holy Quran related to Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) and discusses fitty of them. Before concluding this chapter, we shall mention a couple of Quranic verses acknowledged by both Shia and Sunni scholars to be about Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.).

Describing the characteristics of the pious, Allah the Almighty says,

•those who believe in the Unseen. 

Surah Baqarah (2): Verse 3

Interpreters have implied the occultation of Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) as one aspect of the Unseen for he will have a prolonged occultation.2

•Ahle Sunnah: Tafseer-e-Neshapoori, refer under the aforementioned verse 

Shia: Al-Muhajjah, Sayed Hashim Bahraani (r.a). pg. 149. There are various other verses which have been brought in the beginning of each chapter of this syllabus.

•He is the One Who sent His Messenger with guidance and true religion so that He may dominate it over all other religions even if the polytheists dislike it. 3

Surah Taubah (9): Verse 33

•According to Shia and Sunni interpreters, this dominance will be achieved only after the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.).

Al-Muhajjah, pg. 86, Ahle Sunnat: Tafseer Mafaateeh al-Ghaib (also famous as Tafseer-e-Kabeer)  of Fakhre Raazi, vol. 16, pg. 40.
___________  
3->Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) in the light of Traditions:

•Surely the number of months with Allah is twelve in the Book of Allah since the day the skies and the earth were created.

Surah Taubah (9): Verse 36

The glad tiding concerning the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) is so deﬁnite that many years before his birth, companions of the seventh and eight Imams (as) have written books about his occultation and reappearance. Therefore, rarely can one ﬁnd any book of tradition devoid of the mention of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.).

The Musnad of Ahmad b. Hanbal (exp. 241 A.H.) is the oldest authentic book of traditions of the Ahle Sunnat. It contains approximately one hundred traditions regarding Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.). Moreover, Sunane Abi Dawood (275 AH), Sunane lbn Maajah (273 A.H.) and Sunane Tirmidhi (297 A.H.) have each devoted one chapter to Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.). Moreover, Ahle Sunnat scholars have written more than a hundred books speciﬁcally on this subject. Books comprising at least one chapter on Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) are numerous.

There is no dispute regarding the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.). The Sunnis have gone to the extent of narrating the following tradition from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.),

•One who denies the Mahdi has indeed disbelieved.

Al-Burhaan fi alaamaate Mahdi Aakherez Zamaan by Allama Muttaqi.

Moreover, they have also narrated the following tradition from Allah's Messenger (s.a.w.a.):

•If there remains only one day for the end of this world, Allah will prolong that day till He raises a person from my progeny whose name will be my name and whose agnomen will be my agnomen. He will fill the earth with justice and equity as it would be fraught with injustice and tyranny.3

Sunane Abi Dawood, Kitab al-Mahdi, Trad. 2482; Sunan Tirmidhi, Bab-o-Ma Jaa fil Mahdi, Trad. 2231.
___________ 
4->The Imamat of Imam Mahdi(a.t.f.s.):

•O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those who possess authority among you.

Surah Nisa (4) : Verse 59

Imam Hasan Askari (a.s.) was martyred in Saamarra on the 8th Rabi al-Awwal, 260 AH. That moment marked the commencement of the Imamat of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.). Just as Hazrat Eesa (a.s.) and Hazrat Yahya (a.s.) attained the esteemed position of Prophethood in childhood and Imam Muhammad Taqi (a.s.) and Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.) were endowed with the holy status of Imamat before adulthood, Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) too reached this hallowed position at a very young age. For, Allah's position is conferred and endowed and not acquired that it he in need of age or experience. When Hazrat Eesa (a.s.) was in his mother's lap and was hardly a few days old, he (a.s.) had addressed the Jewish scholars thus:

•Surely I am the slave of Allah. He has given me a book and appointed me as a Prophet.

Surah Maryam (19): Verse 30

•After the demise of Imam Hasan Askari (as) his brother Jafar claimed Imamat and rejected the birth of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) outright. He thought it as a good opportunity to recite the funeral prayers ot Imam Hasan Askari (as ) to prove that he is the Imam and that the eleventh Imam (a.s.) had no son as a successor. The true Shias and students of Imam Hasan Askari (as) were aware of the evil designs of Jafar. They watched, in shocked silence, Jafar stepping forward to lead the prayers. Suddenly, a handsome youth stepped forward, caught hold of Jafar‘s robe and thundered,

Uncle! Go back. I will lead the funeral prayers of my father.

Only an infallible can lead the funeral prayer of an infallible.

•On hearing this, Jafar turned pale and retreated without a word.Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) led the funeral prayers.

Kamaaluddin, pg. 475, Trad. 25

4.It is worth mentioning that in the Indian sub-continent, many believe that Jafar, the uncle of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.), had later repented for his misdemeanors and hence is called as Jafar-e-"Tawwab (Jafar the Repentant) and not Jafar-e-Kazzaab (Jafar the Liar). Although we don ‘t have evidence to support this idea but nevertheless Allah knows the Best.

5->The Occultation of Imam Mahdi(a.t.f.s):

The occultation of Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) is divided into two halves: Minor and Major. It is worth noting that even Sunni scholars have narrated traditions concerning occultation in their books. Long before the occultation, traditions have been narrated in detail on the authority of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and other Imam (a.s.). In one tradition, Imam Sadeq (a.s.) says,

•There are two occultation’s for the Qaem, one of them is longer than the other.

Al-Ghaibah, pg. 170, traditions 1&2 and Eqdud Durar, Muqaddas Shaafei, pg. 133 & 134.

The minor occultation commenced with the martyrdom of Imam Hasan al—Askari (as), which also marked the commencement of Imam-e-Zamana’s (a.t.f.s.) Imamat. The duration of the minor occultation was sixty-nine years, i.e. 260-329 A.H.2 The erathereafter is called as the major occultation which will continue till his reappearance.

2.Some people consider the beginning of occultation since his birth. They consider the duration of the minor occultation to be seventy-four years.

The peculiarity of the minor occultation was that there were some special representatives in this period who were a medium between Imam (a.t.f.s.) and the people. They conveyed the letters, questions, wealth, offerings, gifts, etc. to the Imam (a.t.f.s.) and in return, carried his replies to the people. These were four people who became famous as the 'Four Representatives'. Numerous miracles and extraordinary feats were performed by these four representatives, which are recorded in the books of traditions. They used to reside in Baghdad and their graves are found there even today. Their names are as follows:

1) Abu Amr Usman b. Saeed al-Amri (exp. 265 A.H.)

2) Abu Jafar Mohammad b. Usman b. Saeed al-Amri (exp. Jamaadi al-Awwal 304 or 305 A.H.)

3) Abul Qasim Husain b. Rauh al-Nawbakhti (exp. 18th Shabaan, 326 AH.)

4) Abul Ali b. Muhammad al-Seymouri (exp. 15th Shabaan 329 A.H.)

Today, it is more than eleven hundred years since the commencement of the major occultation. During this period, Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) has not appointed any individual as his special deputy. Rather, he has instructed the people to refer to narrators of traditions (those jurists who possess religious knowledge and requisite characteristics) for all religious problems in this period of major occultation.Therefore, nowadays the Maraaje and the great jurists are called as the general representatives of Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.). In one of his signed letters (tauqee '), Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) wrote,

•And for the future occurrences, refer to those who narrate our traditions because they are my proofs upon you and I am the proof of Allah.

Kamaaluddin, pg. 484, Trad. 4

In the period of occultation, Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) is living as an unknown among the people. He goes for Hajj every year. He guides the people and grants refuge to those without shelter. He benefits the people like the sun behind the clouds.3

•The Holy Prophet (s.a.) has mentioned the (benefit of) existence of Imam-e- Zamana (a.t.f.s.) in the period of occultation in this very manner.

Kamaaluddin, pg. 253, Trad. 3

Now in the period of occultation people are not aware of the residence of Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) and are unable to recognize him. They cannot go directly in his presence. But by the command of Allah, there are some fortunate people in the major occultation who got the opportunity to meet and visit Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.). There are numerous such incidents mentioned in authentic and reliable books.4

Great traditionalist Mohaddis Mirza Husain Noori (a.r.) in his books “Najmus Saaqib" and “Jannatul Ma‘waa" has mentioned about it hundred such incidents and meetings.
___________  
6->Longevity:

1.And indeed We sent Nuh to his nation; so he stayed among them for a thousand years save ﬁfty.

Surah Ankaboot (29): verse 14

Allah the Almighty has granted longevity to His Last Proof so that when the big moment arrives, He may grant him permission for reappearance and all his goals will he achieved. Therefore, Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) enjoys a long life and from this aspect, he is similar to Hazrat Nuh (a.s.) and Hazrat Khizr (a.s.). Imam Zainul Aabedeen (a.s.) says,

2.In the Qaem there is a Sunnah (tradition) from Nuh and that is longevity.2

Kamaaluddin, pg. 322, Trad. 4 & 5; pg. 524, Trad. 5

Presently, Imam-e Zamana (a.t.f.s.) is not even half of this age. Prophet Khizr (a.s.) lived in the time of Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) and all Muslims, Shias as well as Sunnis, believe that he is alive till date.3

3.In Surah Kahf (18) verses 60-82, the incident of Hazrat Moosa (a.s) and Hazrat Khizr (a.s.) is related.

The difference between the proclamation of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and the death of Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) is approximately 2,000 years. Thus, Hazrat Khizr (a.s.) is at the very least 2,300 years elder to Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.). Imam Sadeq (a.s.) says that Hazrat Khir (a.s.) was granted a long life so that it may be an example for the longevity of Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.).4

Kamaluddin, pg 257, Trad. 53

4.It is not that only the friends of Allah have been granted long lives. The fact is that even His enemies and opponents have been bestowed with longevity. The best instance is Iblis.

Not only does Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) enjoy a long life, he is also preserved from old age. His visage is like that of a youth.5

5.This fact has been narrated even by the scholars of the Ahle Sunnat. For instance, Eqdud Durar hy Sullami Shaafei. pg. 41 & 44 narrating from Imam Muhammad Baqer (a.s.) and Imam Husain (a.s.)

Whoever sees him will think him to be of forty years or even lesser.

Muntakhabul Asar, pg. 284-285. Trad.2
___________  
7.Virtues of Imam Mahdi(a.t.f.s.):

Like other divine ambassadors, Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) too is infallible. He is free from all defects, sins and impurities. The verse of Tat’heer was revealed in honor of the Ahle Bait (a.s.)1. 

1.“Allah only desires to keep away the uncleanness from you, O people of the House, and to purify you a (thorough) puriﬁcation." (Surah Ahzaab (33): Verse 33)

Hence the command of Imam Mahdi (att.f.s.) is in fact Allah ‘s command, his happiness is that of Allah and his anger is Allah's anger. One can find this statement in Ziyarat-e-Aale Yaasin,

Then truth is that with which you are satisfied and falsehood is that with which you are angry and goodness is that which you command and evil is that which you prohibit.

Barring the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), he (a.t.f.s) is superior to all Prophets (a.s.) and angels. When he reappears, Jibraeel (a.s.) will kiss his hand.

Behaarul Anwaar by Allamah Majlisi (r.a.), vol. 53, pg. 8 narrating from Imam Sadeq (a.s.)

2.Hazrat Eesa (a.s.) will descend from the heavens to assist him in his mission. According to famous traditions among both Shias and Ahle Sunnat, Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) will lead the congregational prayers and Hazrat Eesa (a.s.) will pray behind him.

Muntakhabul Asar, part 7, chapter 8

3.Hazrat Eesaa (a.s.) will be among the helpers of Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) and a commander of his army, Imam Sadeq (a.s.) has expressed his desire to serve him (a.t.f.s).4

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 51. pg 148, Trad. 22 "If 1 find his era, I will serve him for my entire life."

4.When his name was taken before Imam Reza (a.s.), the latter rose, faced the Qiblah,placed his right hand on his head and prayed for his reappearance.5

Muntakhabul Asar, pg. 506, Trad.3

5.He possesses divine knowledge. He is a witness to the entire world and all its inhabitants. Every day, the angels attend to him and present the deeds of his Shias.6

Tafseer-e-Ahle Bait (a.s.) of Surah Baqarah (2): Verse 143 and Surah Taubah (9): Verse 105

6.Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) sees our actions and is aware of each and every deed done by us. He is a witness upon the people from Allah's side. He knows what is in our hearts and is informed of our secrets. In his letter to Shaykh Mufeed (a.r.), he (a.s.) wrote,

7.Then indeed our knowledge encompasses all your news and nothing of your matters is concealed from us.

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 53, pg. 15, Trad.7

8.Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) is the sign of Allah's mercy and benevolence. He is kinder than a father to his son and more benevolent than a mother to her children.8

Al-Kafi, vol. 1, pg. 200

9.In one signed letter to Shaykh Mufeed (a.r.), he wrote,

Surely we are neither negligent in your protection nor are we forgetful of your remembrance.

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 53, pg. 175, Trad.7

10.Imam Sajjad (a.s.) says,

Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) possesses the traditions and characteristics of the previous prophets (a.s.). He has the qualities of Prophets Adam (a.s.), Nuh (a.s.), Ibrahim (a.s.), Moosa (a.s.), Eesa (a.s.), Ayyub (a.s.) and the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). In longevity, he resembles Hazrat Adam (a.s.) and Hazrat Nuh (a.s.). In concealed birth and being away from the people, he is akin to Hazrat Ibrahim (a.s.). In fear and occultation, he is similar to Hazrat Moosa (a.s.). Differences will arise among the people because of him as was the case with Hazrat Eesa (a.s.). In facing difficulties, he is akin to Hazrat Ayvub (a.s.), and like the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.), he will rise with the sword.10

Kamaaluddin, pg. 322, Trad. 38
___________  
8.Reappearance of Imam Mahdi(a.t.f.s.):

•nd to Him submits whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly...1

Aale Imran (3): Verse 83

•Its knowledge is only with Allah and none else.The non-fixation of the time of reappearance has been likened to the time of Qiyamat. In this regard, one can refer to the exegesis of the Ahle Bait (a.s.) under the verse of Surah A'raaf (7): verse 187

Therefore, whoever fixes a time for the reappearance of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.), is a liar and a deceiver. In a signed letter, Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) has warned,

And as for the reappearance, then it is upon Allah. And those who fix a time are liars.

Kamaaluddin, pg. 484, Trad. 4

•But it is also true that the period of occultation (a period of great difficulties and travails for the Shias) can be curtailed and the reappearance hastened through incessant, heartfelt and congregational invocations and supplications. For, Allah the Almighty had reduced the calamities of the Bani Israel by 170 years (which was previously ordained for 400 years) only on account of their entreaties and pleas. He sent Hazrat Moosa (a.s.) to them and saved them from the clutches of the evil Firaun. Thus. Imam Sadeq (a.s.) has exhorted the Shias to pray as much as possible for the early reappearance like the Bani Israel did.4

Tafseer-e-Ayyashi, vol. 2, pg. 154, Trad. 49

•Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) will reappear from the Holy Kaaba, Masjidul Haraam, near Hajar-e-Aswad5 along with 313 companions and helpers.6 

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 52, pg 307, Trad. 8
Refer to Surah Baqarah (2) Verse 148

•At that moment, Archangel Jibraeel (a.s.) will announce his reappearance from atop the Kaaba, a call heard by all the people of the universe.7 

Refer to Surah Shu'ara (26): Verse 4

•The believers, from every nook and corner of the world, will set out for his aid and assistance. Hazrat Esa (a.s.) will descend from the heavens, participate in his army and pray behind him.8

Muntakhabul Asar, part 7, Chapter 8

•Those believers who died while waiting for his reappearance will be brought back to life and will help him in the achievement of his goal. When the number of his supporters and helpers swells to ten thousand, he will announce his revolution.9

Kamaaluddin, pg 378, Trad.2

•After conquering Makkah, he will move towards Madinah and then to Kufa. He will declare the city of Kufa as the capital of his universal government.10

Al-Ghaibah of Shaykh Toosi (r.a.). pg 275, Kaamiluz Ziyaaraat, pg.26, Trad. 11

•Thereafter, he will dispatch his armies to different parts of the world.

One peculiarity of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) is that none of his armies will face the ignominy of defeat. Wherever they will march, victory will be a certainty.11

Refer to the exegesis of the Ahle Bait (a.s.) under Surah Ale Imran (3): Verse 83

•For, anybody facing his armies will submit immediately. The moment they witness the extraordinary feats, signs, conversation, morals, attractive personality and spirituality, it will be extremely difficult for them to deny him. Of course, there will be some resistance and opposition from the staunch opponents of Islam, like the Jews and the enemies of the Ahle Bait (a.s.), but that will be squashed.12

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 52, pg 361, Trad. 129

•Within a short duration of eight months, the entire globe will be under the rule of Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.).13

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 2, pg. 312, Trad. 5

•In these wars and victories, as the companions and helpers will be on the rise, angels too shall descend from the heavens to offer their assistance and help. 14

Behaarul Anwaar, vol.52, pg 388, Trad. 206; pg 327, Trad. 43; pg 324, Trad. 36

•Moreover, natural forces too will support Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.). The enemy will be under such awe and fear that they will develop cold feet.15

Behaaral Anwaar, vol. 52, pg 356, Trad 119

•In all these wars, Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.t.s.) will stand against the oppressors and tyrants. He will snatch whatever they possess and make them pay for their repression and misdeeds. If the unbelievers and polytheists insist on their disbelief and polytheism, he will eliminate them. The enemies of the Ahle Bait (a.s.) will be degraded and humiliated.16

Behaaral Anwaar, vol. 52, pg 373, Trad 167

•The devils among the men and jinn who are busy spreading mischief and corruption in the earth will be annihilated. Rebels, transgressors and deniers will be killed. Shiite Islamic law will be implemented in the entire universe under the leadership of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.).
___________  
9.The Government of Imam Mahdi(a.t.f.s.):

The Holy Quran has discussed the aims of this government in the following words:

Allah has promised to those of you who believe and do good that He will most certainly make them rulers in the earth as He made rulers those before them. And that He will most certainly establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them. And that He will most certainly after their fear give them security in exchange; they shall serve Me, not associating aught with Me. And whoever is ungrateful after this, these are the transgressors.1

Surah Nur (24): Verse 55

In this verse, four aims of Imam-e-Zamana 's (a.t.f.s.) government have been mentioned:

o	Establishment of a Universal Government

The government of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) will be universal, encompassing ﬁve continents. The entire world will have only a single rule. International borders will be wiped out and the world will become a global village.

o	Government of Shiite Islam

The law and culture of this government will be Islamic. Not any Islam but the Islam with which Allah is satisfied and contented i.e. the Islam of Ghadeer.2

The verse of Maaedah (5): Verse 3 which was revealed in Ghadeer Khumm is indicating towards the fact that the Islam by which Allah is satisfied is that of the Imamat and mastership of Ali (a.s.) viz. Shiite Islam. The verse is as follows:

“This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My Bounties upon you and am satisfied with Islam as a religion for you.”


Islam will dominate all religions. Islam will rule the world. The Holy Quran has pointed out towards this reality in the following words:

He is the One Who sent His messenger with guidance and true religion so that it may dominate all religions, even if the polytheists dislike it.3

Surah Taubah (9): Verse 33, Surah Saff (61): Verse 9

Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) will eliminate the hypocrites and enemies ofAhle Bait (a.s.).4

Behaarul Anwaar, Vol. 52, pg. 376, Trad. 77

He will end all innovations introduced in the pure religion of Islam. He will reintroduce, re-establish the forgotten Sunnah and grant it a new lease of life.5

Al-Irshad of Shaykh Mufeed, pg. 364; Behaarul Anwaar, vol.52, pg. 352, Trad. 108

o	Establishment of Justice, Security and Equality

The most important objective of the government of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) is to establish justice and equity and annihilate tyranny and oppression of every kind.

o	Termination of Polytheism

Worshipping only Allah and not prostrating before anybody else is the most elementary aim of human creation. This goal will be achieved in its true and most complete sense in the government of Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s). Hence, only Allah will be worshipped in the whole world and none else. The Holy Quran has mentioned this concept in the following words:

Those had We established them in the earth, would perform prayers, pay the poor rate, enjoin good and prohibit evil...6

Surah Hajj (22): Verse 41.
___________  
10->The Helpers and Companions of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.)

•Then soon will Allah bring a nation, He will love them and they will love Him. They will be humble before the believers and mighty in front of the unbelievers. They will struggle in the way of Allah and will not fear the accusation of any accuser. This is the grace of Allah; He gives it to whomsoever He wishes. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing.1

Surah Maaedah (5): Verse 54

•Initially,the number of helpers and companions of Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) will equal the number of soldiers present in the Battle of Badr.2

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 52, pg. 323, Trad. 32 narrated from Imam Sajjad (a.s.)

•Gradually, their strength will increase till it reaches ten thousand

Kamaaluddin, vol. 2, pg. 654, Trad.2, narrated from Imam Sadeq (a.s.)

•Imam Sadeq (a.s.) has expressed his keenness to serve Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.).

If I reach his era, I will indeed serve him for my entire life.

Al-Ghaibah by No'mani (r.a.), pg. 245, Trad. 46

•Imam Sadeq (a.s.) has described these traits (of companions) thus,

They pass their nights in worship. Their crying during their prayers is like the humming of the honeybee

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 52. pg. 308. Trad. 82

•While describing Strength and Endeavour, Imam Sadeq (a.s.) says,

Each one of them possesses the strength and power of forty people. Their hearts are stronger than steel. They are so strong that if they pass by mountains, they will uproot them. They will not put their swords back in sheaths till Allah is satisfied with them.

Kamaaluddin, vol. 2, pg. 673, Trad.26

•Imam Sadeq (a.s.) while talking about (belief and insight) them (of companions) says,

The believers among whom Allah will make Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) appear will be the chosen ones. They will be worthy for governance and judgment. They will bear deep insight and understanding of religion.

Al-Kaﬁ, vol. 1, pg. 429, Trad. 83

•With respect to Love and Obedience, Imam Sadeq (a.s.) says,

His helpers will touch the saddles if his horse only to be blessed. In the battlefield, they will surround him and act as shield for him. Whatever the Imam desire, will be fulfilled (by them).

Behaarul Anwar, vol. 52, pg. 308, Trad. 82

•Imam Ali Reza (a.s.) says,

An Imam is a close friend, a benevolent father, an equal brother and (like) a loving mother towards her small child.

Al-Kafi, vol. 1, pg. 199
___________  
10->Our Responsibilities:

•	Love - To possess the love of the Ahle Bait (a.s.) in our hearts is the most valuable gift of Allah.1

Tohoful Oqool by Ibne Shoab Harraani (r.a.) Trad. no. 313 from Imam Sadeq (a.s.)

•	Dua – And pray for the reappearance, then in it is your salvation.2

Kamaaluddin, vol. 2, pg. 484, Trad. 4 

•	Awaiting - Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) declares, The best action of my nation is awaiting the reappearance.3

Behaarul Anwaar, vol. 52, chapter 22, Trad. 2, 7, 11, 21, 33 and 56

•	Attachment - Imam Muhammad Baqer (a.s.), Be patient on the performance of the obligatory acts, advise each other to be patient in facing the enemy and maintain relations and attachment with the awaited Imam (a.s.).4

Tafseer-e-Burhaan by Sayed Haashim Bahraani (r.a.), vol. 1, pg. 334, Trad. 2,3,12

We hope that Allah the Almighty destines the reappearance of Hazrat Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) at the earliest as promised by the Holy Quran and other divine books.
