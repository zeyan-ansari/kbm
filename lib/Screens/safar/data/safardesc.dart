        "arabic": """Some Common Amaals At the shrine

1.Namaze Jafar Tayyar
2. Ziyarat Jamia-Kabirah
3. Ziyarat Ashura
4. Ziyarat Ameenullah
5. Ziyarat Jamia Aimmatul Momineen followed Dua Aliyatul Mazamin
6. Recite all Duas at least once from Sahifa Sajjadiya.
7. If you have been oppressed, recite the dua in Mafatihul Jinan (Dua Mazloom)
8. Remember Imam-e-Zamana (a.t.f.s.) much especially that the Imams are also awaiting his reappearance to ease their pain in the heart.
9. Remember your marhoomeen (recite ziyarat for them even if it is only 2-3 lines)
10. Pray all your salaat in the Haram. Salat is Qasr (if stay is less than 10 days) except within the shrine of Imam Husain (as) where one has a choice to pray full. 

It is a matter of great fortune for a person if he gets the opportunity for the Ziarat of Imam Ali Reza (a.s.). One should pray with all sincerity that one is bestowed this honour repeatedly. Although people are unaware of its greatness and merits and consider it sufficient to perform this Ziarat once only.

The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) said,

“A part of my body would be buried in Khorasan. Allah would ensure Paradise for the believer who visits it and make hell prohibited for him. If a grief-stricken person does the Ziarat, Allah would dispel his grief. If a sinner does the Ziarat, Allah would forgive his sins.”

Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.) said,

“The reward of the Ziarat of Imam Reza (a.s.) is equivalent to 70 Hajjs accepted by Allah.”

In some other traditions its reward is mentioned to be equivalent to 1000 Hajjs and Umrahs.

This Ziarat would be useful at three important points in the Qiyamat.
1. When the scrolls of deeds would be handed over to their owners, the scrolls of good people would be given in their right hands and those of the sinners in their left.
2. On the Sirat Bridge (Pul-e-Sirat)
3. On the balance of deeds (Meezan). Where the deeds would be weighed. 
It should be clear that there are many Ziarats for Imam Ali Reza (a.s.). His famous Ziarat is only that which is found in authentic books and it is related to shaykh Muhammad bin Hasan bin waleed. He was a teacher of Shaykh Sadooq. From ibne Quluwahy’s book Al-Mazar it is known that this Ziarat is also related by the Holy Imams (a.s.). According to the book Manla Yazarul Faqih the Ziarat is as follows: When you decide to go for the Ziarat of Imam Ali Reza (a.s.), before you begin your journey from home, perform Ghusl and while doing to recite the following:
اَللّـهُمَّ طَهِّرْني وَطَهِّرْ لي قَلْبي وَاشْرَحْ لي صَدْري وَاَجْرِ عَلى لِساني مِدْحَتَكَ وَمَحَبَّتَكَ وَالثَّناءَ عَلَيْكَ، فَاِنَّهُ لا قُوَّةَ اِلاّ بِكَ، اَللّـهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ لي طَهُوراً وَشِفاءً

When you begin your journey of Ziarat from home recite the following:
بِسْمِ اللهِ وَبِاللهِ وَاِلَى اللهِ وَاِلَى ابْنِ رَسُولِ اللهِ، حَسْبِىَ اللهُ تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللهِ، اَللّـهُمَّ اِلَيْكَ تَوَجَّهْتُ وَاِلَيْكَ قَصَدْتُ وَما عِنْدَكَ اَرَدْتُ

when you reach Mash’hade Muqaddas first perform Ghusl and recite this dua:
اَللّـهُمَّ اِلَيْكَ وَجَّهْتُ وَجْهي، وَعَلَيْكَ خَلَّفْتُ اَهْلي وَمالي وَما خَوَّلْتَني، وَبِكَ وَثِقْتُ فَلا تُخَيِّبْني، يا مَنْ لا يُخَيِّبُ مَنْ اَرادَهُ، وَلا يُضَيِّعُ مَنْ حَفِظَهُ، صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد وَاحْفَظْني بِحِفْظِكَ فَاِنَّهُ لا يَضيعُ مَنْ حَفِظْتَ

when you reach Mash’hade Muqaddas safely, and when youdecide to perform the Ziayat, first do ghusl and while doing it recite the following:
اَللّـهُمَّ طَهِّرْني وَطَهِّرْ لي قَلْبي وَاشْرَحْ لي صَدْري وَاَجْرِ عَلى لِساني مِدْحَتَكَ وَمَحَبَّتَكَ وَالثَّناءَ عَلَيْكَ، فَاِنَّهُ لا قُوَّةَ اِلاّ بِكَ، وَقَدْ عَلِمْتُ اَنَّ قِوامَ ديني التَّسْليمُ لاَِمْرِكَ وَالاِْتِّباعُ لِسُنَّةِ نَبِيِّكَ، وَالشَّهاَدَةُ عَلى جَميعِ خَلْقِكَ، اَللّـهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ لي شِفاءً وَنُوراً اِنَّكَ عَلى كُلِّ  شَىْء  قَديرٌ

After this wear clean and pure clothes and remembering Allah, barefoot walk, towards the shrine with ease and keep reciting this:
اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ ولا اِلـهَ اِلاّ اللهُ وسُبْحانَ اللهِ والْحَمْدُ للهِ

Stand at the entrance to the Haram and seek permission in the following words:
اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي وَقَفْتُ عَلى باب مِنْ اَبْوابِ بُيُوتِ نَبِيِّكَ صَلَواتُكَ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ، وَقَدْ مَنَعْتَ النّاسَ اَنْ يَدْخُلُوا إلاّ بِاِذْنِهِ، فَقُلْتَ يا اَيُّها الَّذينَ آمَنُوا لا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتَ النَّبيِّ إلاّ اَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمْ، اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي اَعْتَقِدُ حُرْمَةَ صاحِبِ هذَا الْمَشْهَدِ الشَّريفِ في غَيْبَتِهِ كَما اَعْتَقِدُها في حَضْرَتِهِ، وَاَعْلَمُ اَنَّ رَسُولَكَ وَخُلَفاءَكَ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّلامُ اَحْياءٌ عِنْدَكَ يُرْزَقُونَ، يَرَوْنَ مَقامي، وَيَسْمَعُوَن كَلامي، وَيَرُدُّونَ سَلامي، وَاَنِّكَ حَجَبْتَ عَنْ سَمْعي كَلامَهُمْ، وَفَتَحْتَ بابَ فَهْمي بِلَذيذِ مُناجاتِهِمْ، وَاِنّي اَسْتَأذِنُكَ يا رَبِّ اوَّلاً وَاَسْتَأذِنُ رَسُولَكَ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ ثانِياً، وَاَسْتَأذِنُ خَليفَتَكَ الْاِمامَ الْمَفْرُوضَ عَلَيَّ طاعَتُهُ عَلِيِّ بْنَ مُوسَى الرِّضا عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ وَالْمَلائِكَةَ الْمُوَكَّلينَ بِهذِهِ الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبارَكَةِ ثالِثاً، أَاَدْخُلُ يا رَسُولَ اللهِ، أَاَدْخُلُ يا حُجَّةَ اللهِ أَاَدْخُلُ يا مَلائِكَةَ اللهِ الْمُقَرَّبينَ الْمُقيمينَ في هذَا الْمَشْهَدِ، فَأذَنْ لي يا مَوْلايَ في الدُّخُولِ اَفْضَلَ ما اَذِنْتَ لِاَحَد مِنْ اَوْلِيائِكَ، فَاِنْ لَمْ اَكُنْ اَهْلاً لِذلِكَ فَاَنْتَ اَهْل ٌ لِذلِكَ

After this, kissing the threshold he should enter reciting the following:
بِسْمِ اللهِ وَبِاللهِ وَعَلى مِلَّةِ رَسُولِ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ، اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لا اِلـهَ اِلاّ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لا شَريكَ لَهُ، وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، وَاَنَّ عَلِيّاً وَلِيُّ اللهِ

            """It is a matter of great fortune for a person if he gets the opportunity for the Ziarat of Imam Ali Reza (a.s.). One should pray with all sincerity that one is bestowed this honour repeatedly. Although people are unaware of its greatness and merits and consider it sufficient to perform this Ziarat once only.
The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) said,
“A part of my body would be buried in Khorasan. Allah would ensure Paradise for the believer who visits it and make hell prohibited for him. If a grief-stricken person does the Ziarat, Allah would dispel his grief. If a sinner does the Ziarat, Allah would forgive his sins.”
Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.) said,
“The reward of the Ziarat of Imam Reza (a.s.) is equivalent to 70 Hajjs accepted by Allah.”
In some other traditions its reward is mentioned to be equivalent to 1000 Hajjs and Umrahs.
This Ziarat would be useful at three important points in the Qiyamat.
1. When the scrolls of deeds would be handed over to their owners, the scrolls of good people would be given in their right hands and those of the sinners in their left.
2. On the Sirat Bridge (Pul-e-Sirat)
3. On the balance of deeds (Meezan). Where the deeds would be weighed. 
It should be clear that there are many Ziarats for Imam Ali Reza (a.s.). His famous Ziarat is only that which is found in authentic books and it is related to shaykh Muhammad bin Hasan bin waleed. He was a teacher of Shaykh Sadooq. From ibne Quluwahy’s book Al-Mazar it is known that this Ziarat is also related by the Holy Imams (a.s.). According to the book Manla Yazarul Faqih the Ziarat is as follows: When you decide to go for the Ziarat of Imam Ali Reza (a.s.), before you begin your journey from home, perform Ghusl and while doing to recite the following:

O Allah purify me and purify my heart and expand my chest and make Your praise flow on my tongue, for surely there is no power except with you. O Allah! Make it a medium of purification and cure for me.
When you begin your journey of Ziarat from home recite the following:

In the name of Allah and by Allah and towards Allah and towards the son of the Apostle of Allah, sufficient for me is Allah, I rely on Allah. O Allah! I turn to You and intend towards You and I desire what is with You. 
when you reach Mash’hade Muqaddas first perform Ghusl and recite this dua:

O Allah I have turned to You and in Your care, I have left behind my family members and my wealth and whatever You have bestowed on me and in You do I trust. Then do not make me unsuccessful, O the One Who does not fail the one who desires Him and does not squander away the one whom He protects, bless Mohammed and the progeny of Mohammed and protect me with Your protection the one whom You protect is not squandered

when you reach Mash’hade Muqaddas safely, and when youdecide to perform the Ziayat, first do ghusl and while doing it recite the following:

O Allah purify me and purify my heart and expand my heart and make Your Praise and Your love and Your extollation flow on my tongue for surely there is no strength except with You and certainly I know that the support of my religion is submission to Your command and the following of the traditions of Your Prophet and witnessing over Your entire creation. O Allah! Make it a means of cure and light for me. Surely You have power over all things.

After this wear clean and pure clothes and remembering Allah, barefoot walk, towards the shrine with ease and keep reciting this:

Allah is most great, there is no god except Allah, Glory be to Allah, All-Praise be to Allah.

Stand at the entrance to the Haram and seek permission in the following words:

O Allah I stand still at one of the doors of the houses of Your Prophet (Your blessings be on him and on his children), because people are not allowed to enter without his permission. So You said: “O you who believe! Enter not the dwellings of the Prophet unless permission be granted you.” O Allah, I hold (as an article of faith) this honoured place of pilgrimage as sacred, in his invisibility just as I was certain and sure of his sanctity in his presence. I know that Your Apostle and You Representatives (peace be on them) are alive, by You permission, and are being sustained, seeing my place of halting, hearing my words and answering my “Salaam” Although You have shut off their speech from my hearing but has unbolted the door of my understanding, because of my delightful recitation of their merits. First I ask for Your permission O my Lord, and then seek Your Apostle’s leave (Blessings of Allah be on him and on his children), and take permission from Your representative, obedience unto whom has been made obligatory on me Ali bin Moosa al-Reza (a.s.) And also from the angels, appointed as guardians of this blessed precinct. May I enter O Apostle of Allah? May I enter O Hujjatullah (proof of Allah)? May I enter O favourite angels of Allah, quartered in this place of pilgrimage? Give permission to enter, O my Master, a most cordial welcome that is extended to any of your closest friends; may be I do not deserve it, but you are known to do this.

After this, kissing the threshold he should enter reciting the following:

In the name of Allah and by Allah and upon the nation of the Apostle of Allah (s.a.w.). I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, the One, there is no partner for Him and I bear witness that Mohammed is His Apostle and Ali is His representative.

Then one should stand facing the Zari while ones back should be to the Qibla, and one should say:

I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, the One; and there is no partner to share with Him. I bear witness that Mohammad is His servant and His Apostle, verily, he is the lord of the ancients and the moderns, verily, he is the head of the Prophets and the Apostles. O Allah send blessings on Mohammad, Your servant, Your Apostle and Your Prophet, the chief of all that has been created by You, blessings which no one is able to measure other than You. O Allah send blessings on the Ameer ul Moomineen, Ali son of Talib, Your servant, the brother of Your Apostle, whom You elected to have Your knowledge, made him a guide to show the right path to those of Your servants who want to be led aright, an evident proof for those who pay careful attention to Your Message, he managed the affairs of the religion according to Your system of justice, made application of Your commands to settle the issues which cropped up among the people, and let Your will and command rule supreme in all matters; peace be on him, also mercy and blessings of Allah, O Allah send blessings on Fatemah, the daughter of Your Prophet, the wife of Your friend, the mother of the two sons, Hasan and Husayn, the prime leaders of the people of Paradise, she is pure, purified, pious, content, wise leader of all the women of the Paradise, blessings which no one is able to measure other than You. O Allah send blessings on Hasan and Husayn, the two sons of Your Prophet, the prime leaders of the people of Paradise, Your established authority among the people, Your two evident proofs for those who pay careful attention to Your Message, who managed the affairs of the religion according to Your system of justice, and made application of Your commands to settle the issues which cropped up among the people. O Allah send blessings on Ali son of Husayn, Your servant, Your established authority among the people, Your evident proof for those who pay careful attention to Your Message, who managed the affairs of the religion according to Your system of justice, and made application of Your commands to settle the issues which cropped up among the people, the lord among Your adorers. O Allah send blessings on Mohammad son of Ali, Your servant, Your representative in the earth, the deeply versed in the knowledge of Prophets. O Allah send blessings on Ja’far son of Mohammad, the truthful, Your servant, the defender of Your religion, Your decisive argument over the mankind, the truthful, the just. O Allah send blessings on Moosa son of Ja’far, Your upright servant, Your approved spokesman among Your people, Your decisive argument over the mankind. O Allah send blessings on Ali son of Moosa who pleased You most, the chosen, Your servant, the defender of Your religion, rightly and justly established by You as an authority who made earnest presentation of arguments to promote Your religion which is the religion of his truthful ancestors, blessings which no one is able to measure other than You. O Allah send blessings on Mohammad son of Ali, Your servants, Your chosen representative, appointed by Your command, who invited people unto Your path. O Allah send blessings on Ali son of Mohammad, Your servant, the defender of Your religion. O Allah send blessings on Hasan son of Ali who put Your system into practice, the established authority among the people, Your demonstrator who carried out the mission of Your Prophet, Your witness over the mankind, distinguished with Your excellence, who reminded people to obey You and Your Apostle. Your blessings be on all of them. O Allah send blessings on Your demonstrator, Your established representative among the people, perfect, growing and everlasting blessings, expedite his arrival and help him, let us be with him in this world and in the Hereafter. O Allah I seek Your nearness through my love for them. I make friends with their friends, I oppose their enemies, so, on account of them, give me good of this world and the Hereafter, keep away from me the evil of this world and the Hereafter, the dreadful fright on the Day of Judgement.

Sit at the head side and recite:

Peace be on you, O the representative of Allah! Peace be on you, O the evident proof of Allah! Peace be on you, O the light of Allah in the darkness of this (ignorant) world! Peace be on you, O the mainstay of the religion! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Adam, the sincerely attached friend of Allah! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Nooh, the Prophet of Allah! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Ibrahim, the intimate friend of Allah! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Ismaeel, the sacrifice offered to Allah! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Moosa, who spoke to Allah! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Isa, who received mercy, joy and ease from Allah! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Mohammad, the Apostle of Allah! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of the Ameer ul Moomineen, the representative of Allah, the executor of the will of the Apostle of the Lord of the worlds! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Fatimah Zahra! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Hasan and Husayn, the prime leaders of the people of the Paradise! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Ali son of Husayn, the pride of the worshippers! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Mohammad son of Ali, the deeply versed in the wisdom of the ancients and the moderns! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Ja’far son of Mohammad, the truthful, the virtuous! Peace be on you, O the Inheritor of Moosa son of Ja’far! Peace be on you, O the faithful witness of the truth, the martyr! Peace be on you, O the virtuous and pious guardian! I bear witness that, verily, you established the prayers, gave the prescribed share to the needy, commanded to do that which is right and lawful, not to do that which is wrong and unlawful, sincerely served Allah, till the inevitable came unto you. Peace be on you, O Abul Hasan, and mercy and blessings of Allah be on you.

After this one should cling tightly to the Zari and recite:

O Allah I had left my place of domicile to go towards You, and crossed many a town in the hope of getting Your mercy, therefore, do not disappoint me, do not send me away without awarding that which I need, have mercy on my restless agitation near the son of Your Apostle’s brother, Your blessings be on him and on his children. My father and mother are at your disposal O my Master! I have come to visit you, adore you and take refuge with you from the excesses I indulged into, from the burden of sins I carry on my back, so, in the day of distress, be my advocate before Allah, because you enjoy special privileges in the presence of Allah, and He shows respect for you and brings honour to you.

After this one should raise ones right hand and keep ones left hand on the blessed grave and recite the following:

O Allah I seek Your nearness through my love and friendship for them (the Ahl ul Bayt), I love each and every one of them, from the first to the last, and avoid intimate association with anyone other than them Ahlul Bayt, curse of Allah be on those who subverted Your “Favour” suspected Your Prophet to be guilty of falsehood, denied Your revelation, laughed at Your representatives, and gave preference to nonentities over the progeny of Mohammad. O Allah I seek Your nearness by calling down curses on them, I keep myself aloof from them, in this in this world and in the Hereafter, O Beneficent!

After this one should return to the feet side and recite as follows:

Blessings of Allah be on you, O Abal Hasan! Blessings of Allah be on you soul and your body! You suffered patiently and exercised selfcontrol, (although) you were truthful and your truthfulness had been confirmed; Allah destroyed him who gave the orders to kill you, and him who carried it out.

Afterwards one should weep and lament and invoke curses (La’nat) on the enemies of Amirul Momineen (a.s.), Imams Hasan and Husain (a.s.) and other members of Ahle Bayt (a.s.). Then one should go back to the headside and recite 2 Rakats of Namaz-e- Ziarat. In the first rakat after Surah Hamd recite Surah Yasin and in the second rakat after Surah Hamd recite Surah Rahman. After this one should beg and lament to the Almighty and pray fervently for oneself and ones parents and all brothers in faith.

After completing the Ziarat one should recite curse (La’nat) on the killers and oppressors of Ahle Bayt (a.s.) and recite as follows:

O Allah! Curse the killers of the commander of the faithful and the killers of Hasan and Husayn (a.s.) and the killers of the household of Your Prophet. O Allah! Curse the enemies of the progeny of Mohammed and their killers and increase their punishment and debasement and degradation and humiliation. O Allah! Drive them towards Hell fire and engulf them in the torture of Your punishment and gather them and their followers in groups proceeding towards Hell.

Recite 2 units (Rakats) of Namaz-e-Ziarat and then recite the following Dua:

O Allah! I beseech You, O Allah! The Eternal in His kingdom, the Established by His honour, the Obeyed in His authority, the Unique in His greatness, the One in the eternity of His existence, the Just with His creation. The Learned in His decrees, the Noble in the delaying of His punishment O my God! My needs are expended towards You and my hopes are fixed on You, then whenever You have helped me in the performance of a good action, then You are my proof upon it and my way towards it. O the Omnipotent Who does not get tired by the demands, O the powerful in Whom every hopeful sects refuge, I am also accompanied by Your bounties always and Your favours and honour are continuously being pouredon me. I beseech You, by Your power, which pervades all things and Your definite decree which can be warded off by the easiest of supplication and by the vision with which when You looked toward the mountains, they became tall in stature and towards the land they became expansive and towards skies, they became raised and towards the oceans, they started flowing. O the One Who is exalted above the vision of man, and more subtle than the notion’s of the minds. You are not praised, O my master except by the help from You which itself demands another praise and You are not thanked upon the smallest favour except that it You make obligatory another thanks (for getting the opportunity to offer thanks). Then when and how can Your bounties be enumerated and Your favours be requited, O my master, and Your creations be sufficed. O my master! Through Your bounties, the praises land You and through Your gratitude, the thankful offer thanks and You are relied upon for the sins due to Your forgiveness and the spreading of Your wings of concealment over the sinners and You remove the difficulties by Your Hand thus there are so many evils which Your forbearance has covered so much that they have been totally nullified and so many good deeds which You Grace has multiplied to the extend that Your recompense for them has been great. You are so exalted that anything is feared from You except justice or be hoped from you except Favours and Grace. Then favour me with what Your grace has made obligatory and do not degrade me by what Your justice demands. O my master! Had the earth known about my sins, it would have swallowed me up and if the mountains knew about them, they would fall on me, if the skies knew of my sins, they would have seized me, if the oceans knew about them, they would have drowned me. O my master, my master, my master! My chief, my chief, my chief! So many times I have been under Your hospitality, then do not deny me what You have promised those who ask from You. O the one Whom the cognizant recognise, O the One Whom the worshippers adore, O the One Whom the grateful thank! O the companion of the mentioners, O the praised one of those who extoll Him and O the present one of those who seek Him, O the described one of those who consider Him to be one! O the beloved of those who love Him, O the succour of those who desire Him, O the object of desire of those who turn to Him, O the One except Whom, none knows the unseen, O the One except Whom, none can repel evil, O the One except Whom none can regulate the affairs, O the One, except Whom, none can forgive sins. O the one, except Whom none can create the creation, O the one except whom none can send down rain, bless Mohammed and his progeny and forgive me, O the best of forgivers. O my Lord! I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of shame And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of hope. And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of repentance And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of yearning And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of obedience And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of faith And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of attestation. And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of sincerity And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of piety And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of reliance And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of humiliation And I seek forgiveness from you, a forgiveness of one who works for you, and has run away from Youbut has now turned towards You. Then bless Mohammed and the progeny of Mohammed and turn to me and my parents with what You turn to Your entire creation, O the most merciful of all those who show mercy. O the one who is named Forgiving, Merciful, O the one who is named Forgiving, Merciful, O the one who is named Forgiving, Merciful, bless Mohammed and the progeny of Mohammed and accept my repentance and purify my actions and recompense my efforts and have mercy on my walting and do not cover my voice and do not fail me in my demands. O the helper of those who seek help and convey my utations and my prayers to my leaders and make them intercede for me in all that I ask You and make my presents reach them just as they are worthy of and increase for them in it as behoves You with a multiplication which none can enumerate except You and there is no power and no strength except with Allah, the Elevated, the Great and the blessings of Allah be on the most purified of all the Apostles, Mohammed and his infallible progeny.""",

ALLAAHUMMA ELAYKA WAJJAHTO WA A'LAYKA KHALLAFTO AHLEE WA MAALEE WA MAA KHAWWALTANEE WA BEKA WASIQTO FALAA TOKHAYYIBNEE YAA MAN LAA YOKHAYYEBO MAN ARAAADAHU WA LAA YOZAYYE-O' MAN HAFEZAHU SALLE A'LAA MOHAMMADIN WA AALE MOHAMMADIN WAH-FAZNEE BE HIFZEKA FA-INNAHU LAA YOZEE-O' MAN HAFIZTA 

when you reach Mash'hade Muqaddas safely, and when you decide to perform the Ziayat, first do ghusl and while doing it recite the following: 

ALLAAHUMMA TAHHIRNEE WA HAHHIRLEE WASH-RAH LEE SADREE WA AJRENEE A'LAA LESAANEE MIDHATAKA WA MAHABBATAKA WAS-SANAAA-A A'LAYKA FA-INNAHU LAA QUWWATA ILLAA BEKA WA QAD A'LIMTO ANNA QEWAAMA DEENIT TASLEEMO LE AMREKA WAL-ITTEBAA-O' LE SUNNATE NABIYYEKA WASH-SHAHAADATO A'LAA JAMEE-E' KHALQEKA ALLAAHUMMAJ-A'LHO LEE SHE-FAAA-AN WA NOORAN INNAKA A'LAA KULLE SHAY-IN QADEERUN

“If one performs the Ziyarat of Hazrat Ameerul Momineen
(a.s.) in such a condition that he believes him to be the
Imam whose obedience is compulsory and that he is the
immediate successor Caliph of the Messenger of Allah
(s.a.w.a.), and he performs this Ziaarat without pride and
arrogance, the Almighty Allah would give him the reward
of a hundred thousand martyrs. All his past and future
sins would be forgiven. On the day of Qiyamat he would
be safe and secure from the difficulties of Qiyamat. His
accounting would be easy. Angels would welcome him.
When he returns after Ziyarat, the angels would
accompany him till his house. If he falls sick, the angels
would visit him, if he dies, the angels would condole him
and seek forgiveness for him.”
The Ziyarat which has been related by Shaykh Mufid (a.r.), Shaheed
(a.r.) and Sayyed Ibne Taaoos (a.r.) is recited according to the
following method.
When you decide to perform the Ziyarat, first do Ghusl, wear pure
clothes, apply perfume. But, if these facilities are not available it is
sufficient. When you leave your house recite the following dua: 

اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي خَرَجْتُ مِنْ مَنْزِلي اَبْغي فَضْلَكَ، وَاَزُورُ وَصِيَّ نَبِيِّكَ صَلَواتُكَ عَلَيْهِما، اَللّـهُمَّ فَيَسِّرْ ذلِكَ لي، وَسَبِّبِ الْمَزارَ لَهُ، وَاخْلُفْني في عاقِبَتي وَحُزانَتي بِاَحْسَنِ الْخِلافَةِ يا اَرْحَمَ الرّاحِمينَ 
      
After this say: 
اَلْحَمْدُ للهِ وَسُبْحانَ اللهِ وَلا اِلـهَ اِلاَّ اللهُ

Continue to repeat the above as you walk and when your reach the moat of Kufa recite as follows: 
 اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ، اَهْلَ الْكِبْرِياءِ وَالَْمجْدِ وَالْعَظَمَةِ، اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ اَهْلَ التَّكْبير وَالتَّقدْيسِ وَالتَّسْبيحِ وَالاْلاءِ، اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ مِمّا اَخافُ وَاَحْذَرُ، اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ عِمادي وَعَلَيْهِ اَتَوَكَّلُ، اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ رَجائي وَاِلَيْهِ اُنيبُ، اَللّـهُمَّ اَنْتَ وَلِىُّ نِعْمَتي، وَالْقادِرُ عَلى طَلِبَتي، تَعْلَمُ حاجَتي وَما تُضْمِرُهُ هَواجِسُ الصُّدُورِ، وَخَواطِرُ النُّفُوسِ، فَاَسْأَلُكَ بِمُحَمَّد الْمُصْطَفَى الَّذي قَطَعْتَ بِهِ حُجَجَ الُْمحْتَجّينَ، وَعُذْرَ الْمُعْتَذِرينَ، وَجَعَلْتَهُ رَحْمَةً لِلْعالَمينَ، اَنْ لا تَحْرِمْني ثَوابَ زِيارَةِ وَلِيِّكَ وَأخي نَبِيِّكَ اَميرِ الْمؤْمِنينَ وَقَصْدَهُ، وَتَجْعَلَني مِنْ وَفْدِهِ الصّالِحينَ وَشِيعَتِهِ الْمُتَّقينَ، بِرَحْمَتِكَ يا اَرْحَمَ الرّاحِمينَ

And when the dome is sighted, say: 
اَلْحَمْدُ للهِ عَلى مَا اخْتَصَّني بِهِ مِنْ طيبِ الْمَوْلِدِ، وَاسْتَخْلَصَني اِكْراماً بِهِ مِنْ مُوالاةِ الاَْبْرارِ السَّفَرَةِ الاَْطْهارِ، وَالْخَيَرَةِ الاَْعْلامِ، اَللّـهُمَّ فَتَقَبَّلْ سَعْيي اِلَيْكَ، وَتَضَرُّعي بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ، وَاغْفِرْ لِيَ الذُّنُوبَ الَّتي لا تَخْفى عَلَيْكَ، اِنَّكَ اَنْتَ اللهُ الْمَلِكُ الْغَفّارُ

Writer - The compiler of Mafatihul Jinan - says: When the Zaaer sees the dome for the first time a feeling of great liking and yearning for Ziyarat is felt in his heart and thus his attention is fully concentrated towards Ali (a.s.). When you see the dome, recite as follows: 
اَلْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذي هَدانا لِهذا وَما كُنّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلا اَنْ هَدانَا اللهُ، اَلْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذي سَيَّرَني في بِلادِهِ، وَحَمَلَني عَلى دَوابِّهِ، وَطَوى لِيَ الْبَعيدَ، وَصَرَفَ عَنِّي الَْمحْذوُرَ، وَدَفَعَ عَنِّي الْمَكْرُوهَ، حَتّى اَقْدَمَني حَرَمَ اَخي رَسُولِهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ 
       
As you enter the city, recite:
اَللّـهُمَّ بِبابِكَ وَقَفْتُ، وَبِفَنائِكَ نَزَلْتُ، وَبِحَبْلِكَ اعْتَصَمْتُ، وِلِرَحْمَتِكَ تَعَرَّضْتُ، وَبِوَلِيِّكَ صَلَواتُكَ عَلَيْهِ تَوَسَّلْتُ، فَاجْعَلها زِيارَةً مَقْبُولَةً، وَدُعاءً مُسْتَجاباً 

Whey you reach the gate of the courtyard, say: 
 اَللّـهُمَّ اِنَّ هذَا الْحَرَمَ حَرَمُكَ، وَالْمَقامَ مَقامُكَ وَاَنَا اَدْخُلُ اِلَيْهِ اُناجيكَ بِما اَنْتَ اَعْلَمُ بِهِ مِنّي وَمَنْ سِرِّي وَنَجْوايَ، اَلْحَمْدُ للهِ الْحَنّانِ الْمَنّانِ الْمُتَطَوِّلِ الَّذي مِنْ تَطَوُّلِهِ سَهَّلَ لي زِيارَةَ مَوْلايَ بِاِحْسانِهِ، وَلَمْ يَجْعَلْني عَنْ زِيارَتِهِ مَمْنُوعاً، وَلا عَنْ وِلايَتِهِ مَدْفُوعاً، بَلْ تَطَوَّلَ وَمَنَحَ، اَللّـهُمَّ كَما مَنَنْتَ عَلَيَّ بِمَعْرِفَتِهِ فَاجْعَلْني مِنْ شيعَتِهِ، وَاَدْخِلْنيِ الْجَنَّةَ بِشَفاعَتِهِ، يا اَرْحَمَ الرّاحِمينَ .

        "translation": """Hazrat Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) said:
“If one performs the Ziyarat of Hazrat Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) in such a condition that he believes him to be the
Imam whose obedience is compulsory and that he is the immediate successor Caliph of the Messenger of Allah
(s.a.w.a.), and he performs this Ziaarat without pride and arrogance, the Almighty Allah would give him the reward
of a hundred thousand martyrs. All his past and future sins would be forgiven. On the day of Qiyamat he would
be safe and secure from the difficulties of Qiyamat. His accounting would be easy. Angels would welcome him.
When he returns after Ziyarat, the angels would accompany him till his house. If he falls sick, the angels would visit him, if he dies, the angels would condole him and seek forgiveness for him.”

The Ziyarat which has been related by Shaykh Mufid (a.r.), Shaheed
(a.r.) and Sayyed Ibne Taaoos (a.r.) is recited according to the following method.

When you decide to perform the Ziyarat, first do Ghusl, wear pure
clothes, apply perfume. But, if these facilities are not available it is
sufficient. When you leave your house recite the following dua:

O Allah I step out of my lodging, Seek Your favor, and proceed to
visit the executor of Your Prophet’s will, Your blessings be on them.
O Allah, make it easy for me, let my visit take place smoothly, Let me
succeed in my fulfillment And attendance, and let it be a fairly
auspicious success, O the most Merciful of all who show mercy.

After this say:
All Praise is for Allah and Glory be to Allah and there is no god
except Allah.

Continue to repeat the above as you walk and when your reach
the moat of Kufa recite as follows: 

Allah is the Greatest, Allah is the Greatest True owner of greatness might and majesty. Allah is the Greatest, (He alone) is worthy of
sublimity, Purity, glory and beneficence Allah is Greatest, I stand in
awe of His greatness, and take alarm. Allah is Greatest, I rely upon
Him and resign to His will. Allah is Greatest, I lean on Him and turn
to Him. O Allah You are my Master of my bounties, And able to
satisfy my demands, you know my needs And that which the
troubled thoughts And apprehensive nature conceal, Therefore, I
beseech You in the name of Mohammad (whom You elected) To
silence the pseudo antagonists and sham pretenders. Through him,
and made him “Mercy unto the worlds”, Not to deprive me of
recompense available to me if I perform the visitation of Your
friend, And Your Prophet’s brother, leader of the faithful and also of
my determination on him, let me be among the worthy visitors And
pious partisans, through Your mercy, O the Most Merciful. 

And when the dome is sighted, say: 

Praise be to Allah because He distinguished me with a good and
lawful birth, And as a favor, purified me with the friendship of the
virtuous, The chaste mediators, and the models of goodness; O
Allah, therefore, take notice of how I hasten unto You, Solicit
humbly before You; And absolve me of my sins which are not
hidden from You, Verily You are Allah, the King, the Forgiver

Writer - The compiler of Mafatihul Jinan - says: When the Zaaer sees the dome for the first time a feeling of great liking and
yearning for Ziyarat is felt in his heart and thus his attention is fully
concentrated towards Ali (a.s.). When you see the dome, recite as
follows:

Praise be to Allah Who has brought us here, We, on our own, could
not come if Allah has not guided us. Praise be to Allah Who made me
travel in His land, And loaded me on His conveyance and made the
far as near from me He kept me safe from danger, and removed
discomforts, till I entered the Sacred sanctuary of the brother of His
Apostle, blessings of Allah be on him and on his children. 

As you enter the city, recite: 

Praise be to Allah who made me enter His blessed preinct, Which
has been sanctified and selected by Allah For the successor of His
Prophet, O Allah, therefore, let him take notice of (my arrival).
When you reach the first gate say: 

O Allah I stand at Your door, set foot in Your courtyard, hold fast to
Your rope, ask for Your mercy, apply to Your friend and
representative, Your blessings be on him so welcome my visitation
and give favourable answer to my prayer.

Whey you reach the gate of the courtyard, say:

O Allah! Surely this sanctuary is Your sanctuary and this place is
Your place and I enter it I supplicate to Your regarding what You
know better than me about it and my secrets and whisperings All
Praise be to Allah, the Benefactor, the Benovelent, Who, by His
Grace, has made easy for me the visitation of my master and has not
prevented me from his visitation and neither has He repelled me
from his mastership, rather He has favoured and granted. O Allah!
As You have obliged me by his recognition then include me among
his adherents and cause me to enter Paradise by his intercession, O the most Merciful of all those who show Mercy.

When you reach the courtyard say: 

Praise be to Allah Who honoured me with insight in the divine
matters concerning Him and His Apostle, and prescribed for me
obedience unto Him as a duty, an act of mercy from Him to me, a
recurring bounty from Him for me, and choose me to have faith in
Him. Praise be to Allah Who brought me to the sacred resting place of His Apostle’s brother a destination which gives me comfort. Prais
be to Allah who allowed me to be amount the “Zawwaar” (visitors)
of His Apostle’s successor. I bear witness that there is no god save
Allah, the one Who has not taken any partner, and I bear witness
that Mohammad, His bondman and Apostle, had come with truth
from Him, and I bear witness that Ali , the brother of the Apostle of
Allah, is also His bondman. Allah is the Greatest ! Allis is the
Greatest! Allah is the Greatest !There is no god save Allah, Allah is
the Greatest. Praise be to Allah, for His guidance and His granting
opportunity towards what He calls from His way O Allah You are the
most desired real aim, that most generous Welcomer unto whom
one can go to seek nearness. I have come near You to seek Your
nearness, in the name of Your Prophet, the Prophet of mercy. And in
the name of his brother, commander of faithful, Ali son of Abu Talib,
peace be on them. Send blessings on Mohammad and on the
children of Mohammad, let not my effort go waste, treat me
mercifully, promote my interests, make me honoured and respected
in this world and in the Hereafter, and let me be amoung the favourites.

When you reach the entrance of the canopy, say: 

Peace on the Apostle of Allah custodian of His revelations, whom He
entrusted with His divine plan, who brought to fullness and made
perfect that which went before, began that which came ultimately,
preserved and defended both of them; mercy and blessings of Allah
be on him. Peace be on the possessor of tranquility Peace be on him
who is resting in Medina. Peace be on him whom Allah helped and
assisted. Peace be on Abdul Qasim Mohammad, son of Abdullah.
Mercy and blessings of Allah be on him.

Now enter the canopy and enter with the right foot forward and
standing at the door of the shrine say:

I bear witness that there is no god save Allah, the One Who has no
partner. I bear witness that Mohammad is His bondman and His Apostle, who came with truth from Him and certified the (earlier) 
Apostles, Peace be on you O Apostle of Allah. Peace be on you O
beloved friend of Allah, the “Best Individual” among His creation.
Peace be on the commander of the faithfuls, the servant of Allah the
brother of the Apostle of Allah, O Master! O Ameeral Momineen! I,
your bondman, son of your bondman and bondwoman, take refuge
in your shelter, I seek your patronage, I stand, face to face, before
you, I seek nearness of Allah through you, May I enter , O my
Master? May I enter, O Commander of the faithful. May I enter, O
Decisive argument of Allah? May I enter, O Faithful Trustee of Allah?
May I enter, O Angels of Allah, quartered in this place of
pilgrimage?O my Master do I have your permission to enter (a most
cordial welcome that is extended to any of your closest friends)?
May be I do not deserve it, but your are known to do this!

Then kiss the threshold and enter with right foot forward and recite the following dua: 

In the name of Allah, with (relying on) Allah, in the cause of Allah,
following the religion of the Apostle of Allah, blessings of Allah be
on him and on his children. O Allah forgive me, have mercy on me,
accept my repentance. Verily You are the Oft-forgiving Merciful.
Then go before the grave and in standing position before reaching the grave say: 

Peace be from Allah on Mohammad, the Apostle of Allah, the
faithful trustee of Allah’s revelation, message and plan, the
custodian of the Holy Quran, who brought to fullness and made
perfect that which went before, and began that which came after
ultimately, preserved and defended both of them, a witness over
the creation, and a light, giving light, peace, mercy and blessings of
Allah be on him, O Allah send blessing on Mohammad and on his
Ahlul Bayt, who were burdened With many troubles, the best, the
most perfect, the worthiest blessing of all that have been bestowed
upon any of Your Prophets, Apostles and Your chosen friends. O
Allah send blessing on Ameerul Moomineen, Your bondman, Your
best creation, After Your Prophet, the brother of Your Apostle, the
executor of Your beloved friend’s will, whom you elected in
preference over all Your creation, whom you sent as a proof to
confirm the Apostle who spread Your Message, who administered
Your religion according to Your just and fair rules, and made clear
Your commands for the people. Peace, mercy and blessing of Allah
be on him. O Allah and blessings on the Imams, in his progeny,
established through Your command, after him the thoroughly
purified, whom You chose and approved to promote Your religion,
to keep safe Your confidential matters, to give witness about that
which the people do, to set examples for Your believing servants,
Your blessings be on all of them. Peace be on the Ameerul
Moomineen, Ali son of Abu Tablib, the executor of the Apostle of
Allah’s will; his successor, appointed by his mandate to take charge
of the divine mission after him; the first of the (twelve) successors;
mercy and blessings of Allah be on him. Peace be on Fatimah
daughter of the Apostle of Allah, (Allah’s blessings be on him and on
his children), the leader, (chosen) from the women of the worlds.
Peace be on Hasan and Husayn, the two young exclusive leaders of
the inhabitants of the Paradise. Peace be on the rightly guided
Guides (Imams). Peace be on the Prophets and Apostles. Peace be
on the Guides (Imams) whom the divine mission was given in trust.
Peace be on the favourites of Allah from among His creation who
enjoy special distinctions. Peace be on those who possess deep
insight and understand subtleties. Peace be on the faithfuls who
abide by and attend to His commands, help His representatives, and
stand in awe of their reverence. Peace be on the Angles, nearest to
Allah. Peace be on us and on the pious servants of Allah.

Then go near the grave and stand there. Face the grave and keep your back to the Qibla and recite as follows: 

Peace be on you, O Ameer ul Moomineen! Peace be on you, O the
dearest beloved of Allah! Peace be on you, O true friend of Allah!
Peace be on you, O representative of Allah! Peace be on you, O
decisive argument of Allah! Peace be on you, o the Leader of
guidance! Peace be on you, O the symbol of piety! …Peace be on 
you, O He who carried out the divine mission, obeyed Allah, devoted
himself to the service of Allah, selected the best, kept his word!
Peace be on you, O the father of Hasan and Husayn! Peace be on
you, O the mainstay of the religion of Allah! Peace be on you, O the
first of the (twelve) successors, the confidant of the Lord of the
worlds; The administrator of the “day of judgment”, the best of all
believers, the chief of the truthfuls, the purest progeny of the
Prophets, the gate of wisdom of the Lord of the worlds, the
treasurer of His Book, the treasure of His knowledge, the wellwisher of His Prophet’s ummah whom he always gave sincere
advice, the follower of His Apostle, and for His sake staked his own
life to assist (him). Used His “reason and argument” in his own
discourses, and invited people unto the law of God, and introduced
the system approved by Him. O Allah I testify that he took steps to
revive and generate that which Your Apostle entrusted to him Took
care of that which (Your Apostle) put in his safekeeping, protected
that which (Your Apostle) gave over to him in letter and spirit
adhered to that which You has made lawful, proclaimed unlawful
that which You has forbidden, gave effect to Your laws, waged war,
in Your cause, against those who were guilty of the breach of
faith;Against those who swerved from that which was right
according to Your command; against those who deviated from your
true religon, exercising self-control, but retributing good and bad,
and for Your sake did not take to task those who rebuked and
blamed him out of meanness. O Allah send blessings on him, much
and more than that which You has sent on any one of Your close
favourite friends, or Prophets. O Allah this is the resting place of
Your beloved friend, obedience unto whom has been made
obligatory, You has made it compulsory for all Your servants to
acknowledge him as an authority; he is Your representative,
through whom, You catches hold of and also passes over, through
him You gives a reward, and also inflicts penalty. I make the highest efforts to stay attached with him, so that I deserve to be among
Your friends, (such a man) is credited with the highest merits by
You; before You he occupies a noticeable important place, and Your
closest nearness is his final destination; send blessings on
Mohammad and on the children of Mohammad, and do for me that
which Your are able to do, because, verily, You owns generosity and
kindness. Peace be on you, O my Master, and on Aadam and Nooh
who lie (buried) side by side with you, mercy and blessings of Allah
be on you

Then kiss the Zari and standing at the headside, recite the following. 

O my Master I have come to your place, through you, I apply to Allah
for fulfillment of my aim. I am positively sure, that whoso keeps
close to you never comes to grief, whoso asks for satisfaction, fully
aware of your authority, never comes back empty-handed, unless all
his demands are decided and settled in his favour; therefore,
recommend me (my case) to Allah, your Lord and my Lord, for
favourable settlement of my demands, for speedy disposal of my
affairs, for relief from hardships, for forgiveness of my
wrongdoings, for enough means of livelihood, for a long life, and for
granting me that which I have asked for, in this world and in the
Herafter. O Allah damn the killers of the commander of the faithful.
O Allah damn the killers of Hasan and Husayn. O Allah damn the
killers of the Holy Imams, condemn them to eternal punishment.
Like which You has not yet punished anyone in the whole universe,

doomed ever to repeating damnation; which never shall leave them
alone, nor there should be a fixed time, and interval. Lest they many
(again) tear asunder the authourity of Your commands; and keep
ready for them that punishment which none from among Your
creation will ever encounter. O Allah crack down on the killers of the
friends of Your Apostle, and the killers of the commander of the
faithful, on the killers of Hassan and Husayn, on the killers of the
friends of Hasan and Husayn on the killers Of all those
(faithfulls)who were killed in the love of the progeny of Mohammad,
And inflict a painful punishment, and as much again in the lowest
tiers of the burning Fire, so that for them there is no letup in
torment, and they stay there, wrapped in grief, condemned to hell,
hanging down their heads before their Lord, that they (at last) see
with their own eyes what the (inevitable) sufferings is, and how the
shame and disgrace shall last for ever, for killing the children of
Your Prophets and Apostles, and their friends and followers, from
among Your pious servants. O Allah let damnation torment them in
their innermost thoughts and feelings, and in their social
relationship and dealings, during their lifetime in his world, and
after death, in the heaven. O Allah let my approach be sincere in the
matter of Your friends, let me love and take delight in their
presence, near their resting abodes, till You unite me with them,
and let me join them, in this world , and in the Hearafter. O the Most
Merciful of all who show mercy!

Then kiss the Zari and stand with your back to the Qibla and face
towards the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) and recite:

Peace be on you, O Abu Abdullah. Peace be on you, O the son of the
Apostle of Allah. Peace be on you, O the son of the commander of
the faithful. Peace be on you, O the son of Fatemah Zehra the leader
of the women of the universe. Peace be on you, O the father of the
guiding leaders, the guided ones. Peace be on you, O the one who
was felled down while tears were pouring out from his eyes. Peace
be on you, O the possessor of the perfected calamity. Peace be on
you and on your grandfather and your father. Peace be on you and
on your mother and your brother. Peace be on you the leaders from
your progeny and sons. I bear witness that Allah has ordained the
mud as pure because of you and has explained the Book through
you and has made you and your father and grandfather and brother
and sons as examples for the possessors of understanding. O the
son of the auspicious and pure ones, the reciters of the Book. I direct 
my salutations to you, may the blessings of Allah and His peace be
on you and may He made the hearts of the people incline towards
you, He is not unsuccessful who adheres to you and seeks refuge in you.

Then go to the foot of the grave and recite the following.

Peace be on the progenator of the Imams, intimately associated
with the mission of prophethood. Particularly preferred for the
equal affiliation. Peace be on the prima donna of the Religion and
Belief, the Word of the beneficent. Peace be on the standard model
(yardstick, criterion) of the “Ideal way of life”, the director who
plans and executes (all) affairs, the “sword” of the Almighty. The
distributor of the pure water of the fountain of benevolence and
love. Peace be on the benefactor of the faithfuls, the inheritor of the
wisdom of the prophets, the administrator of the Day of Judgement. 
Peace be on the growth (fullness) of piety the hearer of hidden
thoughts and secret communications. Peace be on the “argument”
Allah put forward as a convincing proof. His all-encompassing
mercy, his disciplinary strike. Peace be on the true and clear path,
the distinct and bright star, the sincere and kind Guide, the many
splendoured torch, the mercy and blessings of Allah be on you.

Then say:

O Allah send blessings on the Ameerul Moomineen, Ali Ibne Abi
Talib, the bother of Thy prophet, his successor, his supporter, his
vicegerent, custodian of his knowledge, repository of his
confidential and privileged matters, gate of his wisdom, who gave
tongue to his arguments, invited to his system, and took charge of
the affairs of his followers after him he removed his anxiety and
anguish, he pulled the syndrome of infidelity to pieces, and pushed
the nose of evil into the dust, whom Thou united with Thy Prophet as Haroon was attached with Moosaa.O Allah befriend those who
make friends with him, discard those who show hostility to him,
help those who support him, abandon those who forsake him, damn
those who set up and planted hostile opposition against him,
whether they were his contemporaries or came after in succeeding
generations; and send blessings on him, much and more blessings

prophets, O the Lord of the worlds""",

Another Dua is written in ‘Misbah-uz-Zaereen’ which is recommended to be recited after Namaz-e-Ameerul Momineen. 
يا اللهُ يا اللهُ يا اللهُ يا مُجيبَ دَعْوَةِ المُضْطَرّينَ .

       
The humble servant says that it is the same Dua of Safwaan which is famous as ‘Dua-e-Alqamah’ and which will be mentioned with Ziyarat of Ashoora. It is clear that Ziyarat of the head of Imam Husain (a.s.) is Mustahab (recommended) near the grave of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.). In ‘Wasaael-ush-Shia’ and ‘Mustadrakul Wasaael’ there is a separate chapter regarding this. Mirza Mohammad bin Mashhadi (r.a.) has quoted in ‘Mustadrak’ that Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) recited the Ziyarat of the head of Imam Husain (a.s.) at the head of the tomb of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.), recited 4 rakats Namaz and then recited this Ziyarat:

اَللّـهُمَّ اِنَّكَ تَرى مَكاني، وَتَسْمَعُ كَلامي، وَلا يَخْفى عَلَيْكَ شَيْءٌ مِنْ اَمْري، وَكَيْفَ يَخْفى عَلَيْكَ ما اَنْتَ مُكَوِّنُهُ وَبارِئُهُ، وَقَدْ جِئْتُكَ مُسْتَشْفِعاً بِنَبِيِّكَ نَبِيِّ الرَّحْمَةِ، وَمُتَوَسِّلاً بِوَصِيِّ رَسُولِكَ فَاَسْأَلُكَ بِهِما ثَباتَ الْقَدَمِ وَالْهُدى وَالْمَغْفِرَةَ فِي الدُّنْيا وَالاْخِرَةِ.

            """And recite the Ziyarat of Janab Nuh (a.s.) as follows: 

Peace be on you, O Prophet of Allah!Peace be on you, O he who was sincerely attached to Allah!Peace be on you, O the close friend of
Allah!Peace be on you, O beloved friend of Allah!Peace be on you, O
the spiritual guide of the Apostles!Peace be on you, O the faithful
trustee of Allah on His earth!Blessings of Allah and His greeting be on you, on your soul and body, and on your pure children, mercy
and blessings of Allah be on you. 

Then recite 6 rakats namaz. 2 rakats for Ameerul Momineen (a.s.).

In the first rakat after surah Hamd recite Surah Rahman and in the
second rakar recite Surah Yasin. After the namaz recite the
Tasbeeh of Janab Fatemah Zahra (s.a.) and seek the forgivness of
Allah and pray for yourself and recite as follows: 

O Allah, I have offered these two units of prayer, as present from me
to my master and chief: Your intimate servant, the brother of Your
Messenger, the Commander of the Faithful and the chief of the
Prophets’ successors; namely, Ali the son of Abu Talib, may Allah’s
blessings be upon him and his household. So, O Allah, (please do)
send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,
accept that prayer from me, and confer upon me with the reward
that You give to the good-doers. O Allah, to You have I offered prayer, genuflected, and prostrated myself; to You alone without
associating anyone with You, because prayers, genuflections, and
prostrations are submitted to none save You, because You are Allah;
there is no god save You. O Allah, (please do) bless Muhammad and
the Household of Muhammad, admit my visit, and respond to my requests in the name of Muhammad and his Household – the immaculate ones.

The remaing 4 rakats namaz to be prayed for Hazrat Adam (a.s.)
and Hazrat Nuh (a.s.) and the reward to be gifted to them. Then
perform the sajdah of shukr and say:


O Allah, to You do I direct my face, to You do I resort, and on You do
I rely. O Allah, You are my trust and my hope; so, (please do) save me
from whatever concerns me, whatever does not concern me, and
whatever You know more than I do. Certainly, protected is he who
lies under Your protection, glory be to Your praise, and there is no
deity save You. (Please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the
Household of Muhammad, and hasten their Relief. 

Then keep your face in the same position on the ground and recite 

(Please do) have mercy on my humiliation before You, on my
earnest imploring to You, on my loneliness among people, and on
my amiability with You. O All-generous! O All-generous! O Allgenerous!

Then keep the left side of the face on the ground and recite:

There is no god save You, my Lord; truly, truly. O Lord, I prostrate
myself before You as sign of my worshipfulness and servitude to
You. O Allah, my deed is certainly feeble; so, (please do) grant it
strength by increasing it many times, O All-generous! O Allgenerous! O All-generous!

Then go into sajdah and say Shukran a hundred times and supplicate as much as possible because this is the place for invocations. One
should seek forgiveness of Allah as much as possible because this
is the place of forgiveness of sins. One should ask Allah for legitimate desires, as this is the place where prayers are accepted.
Sayyid ibne Taaoos (a.r.) has written in the book ‘Mazaar’ and other scholars have also mentioned that after every obligatory or
recommended prayer performed in Najaf Ashraf you should recite the following dua:

O Allah, Your determination is surely unavoidable, Your destiny is
unavoidable, Your act is unavoidable, and there is no power and no might except with You. So, O Allah, whatever act You decide on us
and whatever decree You make on us, (please do) grant us along with it patience that repels and fends it off and make it ascend for our good toward Your Pleasure so that it shall grow up our rewards,
favors, tributes, honor, glory, boon, and dignity in this world as well
as the world to come. And (please) do not lessen our rewards. O
Allah, whatever donation You give us, whatever virtue You confer
on us, whatever endowment You bestow on us, (please) grant us
with it thanksgiving that repels and fends it off. And make it ascend
for our good toward Your Pleasure, and ascend in our rewards,
tribute, honor, Your boon, and Your honoring (us) in this world as
well as the world to come. And (please) do not make it to be for us a source of evil, ungratefulness, seditious matter, hatred, torture, or
disgrace in this world as well as the world to come. O Allah, we do
seek Your protection against slips of tongues, evil situations, and
lightness of the Scale. O Allah, (please do) send blessings upon
Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad, make us meet our
the rewards of good deeds at the hours of our death, do not show us
the fruits of our deeds as nothing but regrets, do not disgrace us
when You judge us, do not expose us because of our evildoings on
the Day when we shall meet You, make our hearts remember You
always and never forget You, make our hears fear You as if they can
see You until we meet You, send blessings upon Muhammad and
the Household of Muhammad, change our evildoings into good
deeds, make our good deeds to be grades, change our grades into
chambers (in Paradise), and make our chambers high. O Allah,
(please do) expand the source of sustenance for our poor people
from the expansion that You have taken upon Yourself to make. O
Allah, (please do) send blessings upon Muhammad and the
Household of Muhammad and endue us with true guidance as long
as You grant us life, with honor as long as You keep us alive, with
forgiveness when You decide to cease our lifetime, with protection
in the rest of our lifetime, with blessings in the sustenance that You give us, with help to carry out what You have burdened us with, and with steadfastness against what You have imposed on us. And do not punish us for our wrongdoings, do not treat us on basis of our
lack of knowledge, do not draw us near to destruction gradually on account of our sins, make the best of our words to be firm in our
hearts, make us to be great persons in Your view but humble ones in our own views, make that which You have taught us to benefit us,
and increase us with useful knowledge. And I seek Your protection against a heart that does not submit (to You), an eye that does not
shed tears (for fear of You), and a prayer that is not admitted (by You). (Please do) rescue us from the evil seditious matters, O Manager of this world and the world to come. 

Another Dua is written in ‘Misbah-uz-Zaereen’ which is recommended to be recited after Namaz-e-Ameerul Momineen

O Allah! O Allah! O Allah! O He who gives answer to the cries of the persecuted… till the end.The humble servant says that it is the same Dua of Safwaan which is famous as ‘Dua-e-Alqamah’ and which will be mentioned with Ziyarat of Ashoora. It is clear that Ziyarat of the head of Imam Husain (a.s.) is Mustahab (recommended) near the grave of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.). In ‘Wasaael-ush-Shia’ and ‘Mustadrakul
Wasaael’ there is a separate chapter regarding this. Mirza Mohammad bin Mashhadi (r.a.) has quoted in ‘Mustadrak’ that
Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) recited the Ziyarat of the head of Imam Husain (a.s.) at the head of the tomb of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.),recited 4 rakats Namaz and then recited this Ziyarat:

Peace be upon you, O son of Allah’s Messenger. Peace be upon you,O son of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O son
of the veracious and pure doyenne of all women of the world. Peace be upon you, O my master, Abu-Abdullah. So be upon you Allah’s
mercy and blessings. I bear witness that you offered the prayers, gave alms (zakat), you enjoined the right, forbade the wrong, recited the Book as it ought to be read, strove for the sake of Allah
as it ought to be striven, and stood harm for His sake, seeking His reward, until death came upon you. And I witness that those who 
dissented with you, those who fought against you, those who
disappointed you, and those who slew you – all those are accused in the words of the Ummi (i.e. inhabitant of Umm al-Qura, Makkah) Prophet. And the forger must suffer frustration! May Allah curse those who prosecuted you from the past and the coming generations and may He double for them the painful chastisement.O my master and son of Allah’s Messenger, I have come visiting you
and recognizing your status, showing loyalty to your adherents,incurring the hostility of your enemies, acknowledging the true guidance that you follow, and understanding the deviation (from the right path) of any one who disagrees with you. So, (please) intercede for me with your Lord. 

The writer says: If this Ziyarat is recited at Masjid-e-Hannaanah also
it is all right because Shaykh Mohammad bin al-Mashadi (a.r.) has narrated that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) recited the Ziyarat of Imam Husain
(a.s.) in Masjid-e-Hannaanah in the same way. And recite 4 rakats
namaz. We should know that Masjid-e-Hannaanah is of the
merilorious Majids of Najaf-e-Ashraf. 

According to a tradition the head of Imam Husain (a.s.) was placed there and it is related that
when Imam Sadiq (a.s.) recited 2 rakats namaz there people asked
which namaz he (a.s.) had prayed. He (a.s.) said, “This is the place of
the head of my forefather Imam Husain (a.s.)”. The head was
placed here on way from Kerbala to Ibne Ziyad at Kufa. According
to narrations the Imam (a.s.) said that we must recite the following
Dua here: 

O Allah, You can see my place, hear my speech, and nothing of my
affairs can ever conceal itself from You. How come a thing that You
have created and made conceal itself from You? I have come to you
seeking the intercession of Your Prophet – the Prophet of Mercy,
and seeking the mediation of Your Prophet’s successor. So, I
beseech You in the name of both of them to grant me firmness, true
guidance, and forgiveness in this world as well as the world to come""",

O Ibne Abi Nasr, wherever you may be on the day of Ghadeer you should reach to the grave of Ameerul Momeneen (a.s.). The Almighty Allah forgives the whole year’s sins of the believing men and women on this day and releases from Hell fire twice the number of people that were released in the months of Ramazan, Shab-e- Qadr and Idd-ul-Fitr.

Some Ziyarats are related for this day.

First

Ziyarat-e-Ameenullah which was mentioned before.

Second

The Ziyarat which is related from Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.) through reliable chains of narrators. The year in which Imam (a.s.) was summoned by Mu’tasim he (a.s.) had recited this Ziyarat on Ghadeer anniversary. The method of this Ziyarat is that when one intends to perform the Ziyarat one should stand at the gate of the shrine and seek permission. Shaykh Shaheed says that one should perform Ghusl, wear ritually pure clothes and recite the dua of entry.

اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي وَقَفْتُ عَلى باب مِنْ اَبْوابِ بُيُوتِ نَبِيِّكَ صَلَواتُكَ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ، وَقَدْ مَنَعْتَ النّاسَ اَنْ يَدْخُلُوا إلاّ بِاِذْنِهِ، فَقُلْتَ يا اَيُّها الَّذينَ آمَنُوا لا تَدْخُلُوا بُيُوتَ النَّبيِّ إلاّ اَنْ يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمْ، اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي اَعْتَقِدُ حُرْمَةَ صاحِبِ هذَا الْمَشْهَدِ الشَّريفِ في غَيْبَتِهِ كَما اَعْتَقِدُها في حَضْرَتِهِ، وَاَعْلَمُ اَنَّ رَسُولَكَ وَخُلَفاءَكَ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّلامُ اَحْياءٌ عِنْدَكَ يُرْزَقُونَ، يَرَوْنَ مَقامي، وَيَسْمَعُوَن كَلامي، وَيَرُدُّونَ سَلامي، وَاَنِّكَ حَجَبْتَ عَنْ سَمْعي كَلامَهُمْ، وَفَتَحْتَ بابَ فَهْمي بِلَذيذِ مُناجاتِهِمْ، وَاِنّي اَسْتَأذِنُكَ يا رَبِّ اوَّلاً وَاَسْتَأذِنُ رَسُولَكَ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ ثانِياً، وَاَسْتَأذِنُ خَليفَتَكَ الْاِمامَ الْمَفْرُوضَ عَلَيَّ طاعَتُهُ  فُلانَ بْنَ فُلا ن

In place of فُلانَ بْنَ فُلا ن mention the name of the Infallible whose Ziyarat you are reciting. In the same way mention the name of his father also. For example if you are reciting the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) you should say Al-Husain bin Ali (a.s.) and if you are reciting the Ziyarat of Imam Reza (a.s.) you must say: Ali bin Musa ar-Reza (a.s.) etc. And after that recite the following:

وَالْمَلائِكَةَ الْمُوَكَّلينَ بِهذِهِ الْبُقْعَةِ الْمُبارَكَةِ ثالِثاً، أَاَدْخُلُ يا رَسُولَ اللهِ، أَاَدْخُلُ يا حُجَّةَ اللهِ أَاَدْخُلُ يا مَلائِكَةَ اللهِ الْمُقَرَّبينَ الْمُقيمينَ في هذَا الْمَشْهَدِ، فَأذَنْ لي يا مَوْلايَ في الدُّخُولِ اَفْضَلَ ما اَذِنْتَ لِاَحَد مِنْ اَوْلِيائِكَ، فَاِنْ لَمْ اَكُنْ اَهْلاً لِذلِكَ فَاَنْتَ اَهْل ٌ لِذلِكَ

Then with the right foot forward one should move towards the Zari and standing with the back towards the Qibla and recite:

عَزَّوَجَلَّ : ( اِنَّ الاِْنْسانَ خُلِقَ هَلوُعاً* اِذا مَسَّهُ الشَّرُّ جَزوُعاً* وَاِذا مَسَّهُ الْخَيْرُ* مَنوُعاً اِلاَّ الْمُصَلّينَ )، فَاسْتَثْنَى اللهُ تَعالى نَبِيَّهُ الْمُصْطَفى وَاَنْتَ يا سَيِّدَ الاَْوْصِياءِ مِنْ جَميعِ الْخَلْقِ، فَما اَعْمَهَ مَنْ ظَلَمَكَ عَنِ الْحَقِّ، ثُمَّ اَفْرَضُوكَ س��هْمَ ذَوِي الْقُرْبى مَكْراً، وَاَحادُو عَنْ اَهْلِهِ جَوْراً، فَلَمّا آلَ الاَْمْرُ

وَاَشْبَهْتَ فِي الْبَياتِ عَلَى الْفِراشِ الذَّبيحَ عَلَيْهِ السَّلامُ، اِذْ اَجَبْتَ كَما اَجابَ، وَاَطَعْتَ كَما اَطاعَ اِسْماعيلُ صابِراً مُحْتَسِباً اِذْ قالَ لَهُ : ( يا بُنَيَّ اِنّي اَرى فِي الْمَنامِ اَنّي اَذْبَحُكَ فَانْظُرْ ماذا تَرى قالَ يا اَبَتِ افْعَلْ ما تُؤْمَرُ سَتَجِدُني اِنْ شاءَ اللهُ مِنَ الصّابِرينَ )، وَكَذلِكَ اَنْتَ لَمّا اَباتَكَ النَّبِيُّ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ، وَاَمَرَكَ َاَنْ تَضْجَعَ في مَرْقَدِهِ واقياً لَهُ بِنَفْسِكَ اَسْرَعْتَ اِلى اِجابَتِهِ مُطيعاً، وَلِنَفْسِكَ عَلَى الْقَتْلِ مُوَطِّناً، فَشَكَرَ اللهُ تَعالى طاعَتَكَ وَاَبانَ عَنْ جَميلِ

        "translation":
            """Imam Reza (a.s.) is reported to have said to Ibne Abi Nasr.
O Ibne Abi Nasr, wherever you may be on the day of Ghadeer you should reach to the grave of Ameerul Momeneen (a.s.). The Almighty Allah forgives the whole
year’s sins of the believing men and women on this day and releases from Hell fire twice the number of people that were released in the months of Ramazan, Shab-e- Qadr and Idd-ul-Fitr. 
  
It is also recommended to recite ziyarate ameenullah first.

The Ziyarat which is related from Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.) through
reliable chains of narrators. The year in which Imam (a.s.) was
summoned by Mu’tasim he (a.s.) had recited this Ziyarat on
Ghadeer anniversary. The method of this Ziyarat is that when one
intends to perform the Ziyarat one should stand at the gate of the
shrine and seek permission. Shaykh Shaheed says that one should
perform Ghusl, wear ritually pure clothes and recite the dua of
entry  
  
O Allah, I am standing at the door of one of the houses of Your
Prophet and the family. You have prohibited the people from
entering his house except by the permission of Your Prophet and
You said: “O You who believe do not enter the house of the Prophet
unless permitted to do so”. O Allah, I believe in this in his absence
just as I believe it in his presence and I know that Your Prophet and
Your vicegerents upon whom be peace, are alive in your presence,
they are being nourished, they see my position and hear my speech
and they return my greetings and (I believe) that You have covered
my ears from hearing their speech and have opened the door of
perception of their secret conversations (with You); I seek Your permission, O my Lord firstly; then I seek the permission of Your
Prophet, peace be upon him and his family secondly and I seek the
permission of Your vicegerent, the Imam whose obedience is
incumbent upon me and (the permission of)…

In place of mention the name of the Infallible whose Ziyarat you are reciting. In the same way mention the name of his
father also. For example if you are reciting the Ziyarat of Imam
Husain (a.s.) you should say Al-Husain bin Ali (a.s.) and if you are
reciting the Ziyarat of Imam Reza (a.s.) you must say: Ali bin Musa ar-Reza (a.s.) etc. And after that recite the following:

Your angels entrusted over this blessed site thirdly. May I enter, O
Prophet of Allah, may I enter O the proof of Allah, may I enter, O
angels of Allah who are stationed close to this shrine, so permit me
O my master to enter the best of way that You have permitted any
of Your friends, if I am not deserving of that then You surely are deserving of that.

Then with the right foot forward one should move towards the
Zari and standing with the back towards the Qibla and recite:

Peace be upon Muhammad the Messenger of Allah, the seal of the
Prophets, the chief of the Messengers, and the choice of the Lord of the worlds, whom Allah has entrusted with His Revelations and with His determined commandments, who sealed the previous
Messages, paved the way to the coming blessings, and Who prevails
over all that. May the mercy, blessings, peace, benedictions, and
greetings of Allah be upon him, too. Peace be upon the Prophets
and Messengers of Allah, and upon His favorite angels and righteous saints. Peace be upon you, O Commander of the Faithful,
the chief of the Prophets’ successors, the heir of the Prophets’ knowledge, the friend of the Lord of the worlds, and my master as
well as the master of all of the believers. May Allah’s mercy and
blessings be upon you, too. Peace be upon you, O my master, O
Commander of the Faithful, the trustee of Allah on His lands, the
envoy of Him amongst His creatures, and His conclusive argument against His servants. Peace be upon you, O true religion of Allah and
the straight path of Him. Peace be upon you, O the Great News
about whom they differ and they shall be asked. Peace be upon you,
O Commander of the Faithful. You believed in Allah while they were
polytheists, accepted the truth while they belied it, strove for the
sake of Allah while they refrained, and worshipped Allah with full
sincerity to Him in obedience while you were steadfast, depending
upon Him totally, until death came upon you. Verily, curse of Allah
be upon the wrongdoers. Peace be upon you, O chief of the Muslims, head of the believers, guide of the pious ones, and leader of the white-forehead ones. Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon
you. I bear witness that you are indeed the brother of Allah’s Messenger, the successor of him, the heir of his knowledge, his
trustee on his laws, his representative in his nation, and the first to believe in Allah and to accept as true all that which was revealed to
Allah’s Prophet. I also bear witness that he (i.e. the Prophet) conveyed all that which Allah revealed to him concerning you; so,
he expounded openly what he was commanded (to expound),declared to his nation the duty of obedience and loyalty to you, ordered them to swear allegiance to you, and declared you as enjoying more priority on the believers than that which they enjoy
on themselves in the same was as Allah has made him enjoy the
same. He then asked Allah the All-exalted to be the witness on them
(in this respect), saying, “Have I conveyed?” They answered, “Yes, you have. We swear to it by Allah.” He thus said, “O Allah, be the
witness and You are sufficient Witness and Judge between the servants (of Yours).” Hence, curse of Allah be upon him who denied
the allegiance to you after he had confessed of it and upon him who breached his pledge to you after he had taken it. I also bear witness that you have indeed observed your pledge to Almighty Allah and
that Almighty Allah, in return, shall observe His pledge to you.“Therefore, whoever fulfills what he has covenanted with Allah, He
will grant him a mighty reward.” I also bear witness that you are
truly the commander of the faithful, the Divine Revelation did
declare your commissioned leadership, and the Messenger made a covenant with the people (that they would be under your
leadership). I also bear witness that you, along with your uncle and
brother, traded with Allah in your souls; He therefore revealed
about you this: “Surely, Allah has bought of the believers their
persons and their property for this, that they shall have Paradise;
they fight in Allah's way, so they slay and are slain; a promise which
is binding on Him in the Torah and the Bible and the Qur’an; and
who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah? Rejoice therefore in
the pledge which you have made; and that is the mighty
achievement. They who turn to Allah, who serve Him, who praise
Him, who fast, who bow down, who prostrate themselves, who enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, and who keep the limits
of Allah; and give good news to the believers.” O Commander of the
Faithful, I bear witness that whoever doubts about you has never
believed in the Trusted Messenger, and whoever leaves you to
choose another (as his leader) has indeed diverted the true religion,
that the Lord of the worlds has chosen for us, and that He completed it on the Ghadeer Day through (declaring) the Divinely
commissioned leadership of you. And I bear witness that you are the
one intended in the following saying of the Almighty, All-merciful
Lord: “And this is My path, the right one; therefore, follow it, and
follow not other ways, for they will lead you away from His way.” I
swear by Allah that whoever follows any one other than you has in
fact strayed off the right way and misled others (i.e. those who
imitate him), and that whoever incurs the hostility of you has
undoubtedly rejected the right. O Allah, we have listened to Your
command obeyed, and followed Your straight path; therefore,
(please do) guide us, O our Lord! And do not cause our hearts to
deviate after You have guided us to the obedience to You, and
include us with those who always thank You for Your bounties. And
I also bear witness that you have always been at variance with
whimsical desires as you have always been in line with piety, you
have always been capable of suppressing your rage, you have
always forgiven and pardoned people, and when Allah is disobeyed,you have always been furious, and when He is obeyed, you have
always been pleased, and you have always carried out what Allah
has commissioned you to do, you have always observed what has
been entrusted with you, you have always kept what has been
confided to you, you have always conveyed what you were ordered
to convey, and you have always expected that which you were
promised. And I bear witness that as you sometimes conceded some
things, you did not do that on account of humiliation, and as you
sometimes did not demand with your right, you did not do that on
account of fear, and as you sometimes stopped combating those who usurped your right, you did not do so on account of weakness,
and as you (on a certain occasion) showed contentment to things to
which Allah is not pleased, you did not do so on account of flattery,
and you have never been weakened by what befell you for the sake
of Allah, and you have never been feeble and you have never
abased yourself as regards demanding with your rights on account of fear. I seek Allah’s refuge against such claims; rather, when you
were wronged, you relied upon your Lord in these questions and
entrusted your affair to Him, and as you reminded them (of their
allegiance to you), they did not regard it, and as you preached them,they did not accept from you, and as you instructed them to fear
Allah, they did not mind. I also bear witness, O Commander of the
Faithful, that you strove in the way of Allah in the most appropriate
way until Allah summoned you to be in His vicinity, chose to grasp
you, and established the argument against your enemies who killed
you, so that you should have argument against them, although you enjoy conclusive arguments against all of His creatures. Peace be
upon you, O Commander of the Faithful. You have worshipped Allah
sincerely, striven in the way of Allah steadfastly, sacrificed yourself,
seeking Allah’s judgment, acted upon His Book, followed His
Prophet’s instructions, performed the prayers, paid the zak¡t,
enjoined what is right, and forbidden what is wrong as much as you could, seeking what is possessed by Allah and desiring for that
which Allah has promised. You have never cared for misfortunes,
never yielded to the hardships, and never stopped fighting against
any warrior on account of fear. Indeed, whoever claims anything
opposite to this to you is actually fabricating and is forging lies to
you, and whoever leaves your path is drawing himself near to
destruction. You have certainly striven in the way of Allah as exactly as required, stood harm for the sake of Allah, have been the
foremost to believe in Allah, the first to offer prayer and to strive,
and the first to expose himself in the land of the polytheists, while
the lands were suffocated with deviation, Satan was worshipped
openly, and (in the midst of this) you said, “The big number of
people that surround me shall never increase my might, nor shall
their departing me make me feel lonely. I thus shall never submit
even if all peoples desert me.” Because you resorted to Allah, you
were the mightiest, and because you preferred the Next World to
this worldly life, you have been ascetic. Thus, Allah supported,
guided, chose, and selected you. Your deeds were never
contradictory, your words were never paradoxical, your situations
were never fickle, you have never claimed falsely or forged lies
against Allah, you have never been greedy for the wreckage of this
world, you have never been defiled by sins, you have always had
manifest proof from your Lord, and you have always been certain of
what you do, as you used to guide to the right and to a straight
path. I bear true witness and I truly swear by Allah that Muhammad
and his Household – may Allah’s blessings be upon them – are the
masters of all creatures and you are indeed my master and the
master of all believers, the servant and friend of Allah, the brother,
successor, and heir of the Messenger, who used to say to you, “I swear this by Him Who sent me with the truth: whoever denies you
has never believed in me, whoever rejects you has never confessed
of Allah’s existence, whoever abandons you has actually strayed off,and whoever is not guided be you has never found the way to Allah
or to me. Confirming this, my Lord the the Almighty and All-majestic
says, ‘Most surely, I am most Forgiving to him who repents and
believes and does good, then follows the right path.’ To follow the
right path is to adhere to your Divinely commissioned leadership.”
O master, your favor cannot be concealed and your light cannot be
extinguished. Verily, he who rejects you shall be the most misfortunate wrongdoer. O master, you are the (Divine) claim
against the servants, the guiding to uprightness, and our means on
the Promised Day. O master, Allah has indeed elevated your
standing in this world, raised your rank in the Hereafter, and led you
to that which has not been seen by those who antagonized you,
those who stood between you and Allah’s gifts to you. So, curse of
Allah be upon those who violated your sanctity and those who
prevented you from taking your right. I do bear witness that these
are the biggest losers whose faces shall be scorched by Hellfire and
they therein shall be in severe affliction. And I bear witness that
whenever you did something or you avoided doing something, and
whenever you said something or you kept silent; all these were by
the order of Allah and His Messenger. You thus said, “I swear this by Him Who grasps my soul: when the Messenger of Allah – peace of
Allah be upon him and his Household – watched me striking (the enemies) with my sword ceaselessly, he said to me, ‘O Ali, your position to me is the same as (Prophet) Aaron’s position to (Prophet) Moses; yet, there shall be no prophet after me. I would like to
further inform you that your death and your lifestyle shall be with
me and according to my instruction.’ (Imam Ali continued,) I swear
by Allah that I have not told untruth and none shall belie me, and I
have never strayed off and none shall ever mislead me, and I have
never forgotten my Lord’s instructions to me, and I do follow the true path of my Lord that He showed His Prophet and the Prophet showed me, and, most certainly, I am following the lucid path step
by step.” By Allah I swear, true are your words and you have said
nothing but the truth. Curse of Allah be upon those who compare
you to your enemies, while Allah, Whose Name be elevated, says,
“Are those who know and those who do not know alike?” So, the
curse of Allah be upon those who compared you to those whom
Allah has ordered to follow your leadership, while you are the friend
of Allah, the brother of His Messenger, the defender of His religion, and the one whose preference (to all others) has been declared by
the Qur’an; hence, Almighty Allah says, “And Allah shall grant to the
strivers above the holders back a mighty reward. (High) degrees
from Him, protection, and mercy. And Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.”
Almighty Allah has also said, “Do you make one who undertakes the
giving of drink to the pilgrims and the guarding of the Sacred
Mosque to be like him who believes in Allah and the latter day and
strives hard in Allah's way? They are not equal with Allah; and Allah
does not guide the unjust people. Those who believed, fled their
homes, and strove hard in Allah’s way with their property and their
souls are much higher in rank with Allah; and those are they who are
the achievers of their objects. Their Lord gives them good news of
mercy from Himself and His good pleasure and gardens, wherein
lasting blessings shall be theirs; abiding therein for ever. Surely,
Allah has a mighty reward with Him.” I bear witness that Allah’s
words of praise mean you exclusively and you are the most sincere in the obedience to Allah as you have never accepted any
alternative for the right guidance and you have never associated
anyone in your worshipping your Lord. And Almighty Allah has
responded the prayer of His Prophet – peace of Allah be upon him
and his Household – concerning you. He then ordered him to
proclaim the position of succeeding him in (the leadership of) his
nation, as a sign of showing your elevated position, declaration of
the evidence on your leadership, refutation of the false claims, and
repudiation of all excuses. But when he (i.e. the Prophet) worried
about the sedition that would be aroused by the transgressing
group due to such declaration and he did not want you to be faced
by the hypocrites, the Lord of the worlds revealed to him, saying, “O
Messenger! Proclaim the message which has been sent to you from your Lord. If you did it not, you would not have fulfilled and
proclaimed His mission. And Allah will defend you from men (who mean mischief).” Accordingly, he (i.e. the Prophet) burdened
himself with the loads of (long) walking and stood up under the burning sun in the midst of the desert, where he delivered a speech, made everyone listen to him, and called upon them with rhetorical
language. He then asked them all, “Have I conveyed (the message)?” “Yes, you have. We swear it by Allah,” they answered.
“O Allah, be the witness!” the Prophet said. He then added, “Do I not enjoy more priority to the selves of the believers than that which
they enjoy on themselves?” “Yes, you do,” answered they. He then
took you from the hand and said, “This Ali is now the master of
every one who has betaken me as his master. O Allah, (please do)
support those who support Ali, be the enemy of those who incur the
hostility of Ali, give victory to those who stand by Ali, and
disappoint those who disappoint Ali.” Nevertheless, none believed 
in what Allah has revealed to His Prophet about you except a few.
Similarly, this (Divinely commissioned) declaration did not increase others but obstinacy. In defiance of them, Almighty Allah had
revealed in this connection: “O you who believe! Whoever from
among you turns back from his religion, then Allah will bring a
people. He shall love them and they shall love Him. (They shall be)
lowly before the believers, mighty against the unbelievers. They
shall strive hard in Allah's way and shall not fear the censure of any
censurer. This is Allah's favor; He gives it to whom He pleases. And
Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. Only Allah is your Guardian and His
Messenger and those who believe: those who keep up prayers and
give alms while they are in the state of the genuflection of prayer.
And whoever takes Allah and His messenger and those who believe
for a guardian, then, surely, the party of Allah are they that shall be
triumphant.” Our Lord! We believe in what You have revealed and
we follow the messenger; so, write us down with those who bear
witness. Our Lord! Make not our hearts to deviate after You have
guided us aright. And grant us from Your mercy. Surely, You are the
most liberal Giver. O Allah, We do realize that this is the truth whose
source is You. So, curse those who object, act arrogantly (towards
it), belie, and deny it. And they who act unjustly shall know to what
final place of turning they shall turn back. Peace be upon you, O
Commander of the Faithful, chief of the Prophets’ successors,
foremost of the worshippers, and most ascetic. May Allah’s mercy
and blessings be upon you. So be His peace and compliments. It is
you who served a poor man, an orphan, and a prisoner with food on
account of your love for Him, (you did so) for the sake of Allah, while
you did not ask for reward or thanks. Hence, Almighty Allah has
revealed the following about you: “And they prefer them to
themselves though poverty may afflict them. And whoever is
preserved from the niggardliness of his soul, these it is that are the
successful ones.” Verily, it is you who is the suppressor of rage and it
is you who is the pardoner of people, and Allah loves the gooddoers. It is also you who is the steadfast in distress and affliction, as well as in times of conflicts. And it is you who distributes things
completely equally, who is just among the subjects, and the one
having full acquaintance with the laws of Allah among all people.
Informing about the favors that He has conferred upon you, Allah
the All-exalted says, “Is he then who is a believer like him who is a
transgressor? They are not equal. As for those who believe and do
good, the gardens of Paradise are their abiding-place; an entertainment for what they did.” It is you to whom the knowledge
of the Divine Revelation is given exclusively as well as the laws of
true interpretation (of the Holy Qur’an) and the words of the
Messenger. You are known for your unforgettable situations,
renowned positions, and memorable events, in the Battle of Badr
and the Battle of the Allies (al-Ahzab): “When the eyes turned dull,
and the hearts rose up to the throats, and you began to think
diverse thoughts of Allah. There, the believers were tried and they
were shaken with severe shaking. And when the hypocrites and
those in whose hearts was a disease began to say: ‘Allah and His
Messenger did not promise us (victory) but only to deceive.’ And
when a party of them said, ‘O people of Yathrib! There is no place to stand for you here; therefore, go back.’ And a party of them asked
permission of the prophet, saying: ‘Surely, our houses are exposed.’
And they were not exposed; they only desired to fly away.”
Almighty Allah has also said: “And when the believers saw the allies,
they said: ‘This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us. And
Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.’ And it only increased them in faith and submission.” On that day, you (O Ali) killed their
knight, Amr (ibn Abd-Wadd) and defeated their allies: “And Allah
turned back the unbelievers in their rage. They did not obtain any
advantage. And Allah sufficed the believers in fighting. And Allah is
Strong, Mighty.” On the Battle of Uhud: “When they ran off
precipitately and did not wait for any one and the Messenger was
calling them from their rear.” And you were engaged in preventing
the polytheists from reaching the Prophet, on both sides – the right
and the left, until Almighty Allah drove them back, full of fear.
Hence, He gave victory, by means of you, to the disappointing ones.
On the Battle of Hunayn, as is accounted by the Divine Revelation:
“When your great numbers made you vain, but they availed you
nothing. And the earth became strait to you notwithstanding its
spaciousness, then you turned back retreating. Then, Allah sent
down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers.”
“The believers” were you and your party. You uncle, al-Abbas, was
calling at the defeated party: “O companions of Surah al-Baqarah! O
owners of the Allegiance of the Tree!” He still shouted until a group
responded to him, and it was you who replaced them in fighting,
and it was you who aided the Prophet instead of them. They
therefore returned free from reward, and hoping for repentance, as
was promised by Almighty Allah. He, majestic be His mention, says,
“Then will Allah, after this, turn mercifully to whom He pleases.” As
for you, you were awarded the rank of steadfastness and prized the
great reward. On the Battle of Khaybar, when Allah exposed the
cowardice of the hypocrites and cut off the roots of the atheists, so,
all praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds (for that): “And, certainly,
they had made a covenant with Allah before, that they would not
turn their backs. And Allah's covenant shall be inquired of.” O
master, you are the conclusive argument (of Allah), the clear course,the poured grace, and the radiant evidence. So, congratulations, for
the favors that Allah has given you perdition overtake your
enemies, the ignorant! You presented yourself with the Prophet –
peace be upon him and his Household – during all battles and
expeditions that he led; you always carried the pennon with him
and stroke (the enemies) with your sword before him. Then, due to
your prominent determination and your sagacity in all affairs, he
(i.e. the Prophet) appointed you as the commander on all occasions,
and you were never under the commandment of another. On many occasions, your piety prevented you from doing what you had
decided about a matter, while your rival followed his (personal) lust
and committed that matter. Thus, the ignorant ones thought that
you were incapable of doing that which had been done by your
rival! I swear by Allah that any one who thought so had missed the
right thing and had never found the true guidance. However, you
clarified the misunderstanding in which those who fancied and
doubted fell by your saying – may Allah’s peace be upon you: “One
who has been through thick and thin of life finds the excuses to be
preventing him from orders and prohibitions of Allah, but he
disregards them despite capability (to succumb to them and instead
follows the commands of Allah), while one who has no restraints of
religion seizes the opportunity (and accepts the excuses for not
following the commands of Allah).” You have said the very truth; I
swear it by Allah, and the followers of vanity are indeed losers. And
when the two preachers (of their allegiance) tried to deceive you;
and said, “We want to go on umrah!” You thus answered them, “I
swear by your lives; you do not want to go on umrah; rather, you
want to betray me!” Hence, you made covenant with them again
and you renewed their allegiance to you; but they exerted all efforts
to act hypocritically. And when you drew their attentions to this act,
they neglected, redid it again, and did not follow your advice. Thus,
their end result was loss. After them, the people of Syria (mutinied)!
So, you went to fight them after you had provided all excuses, while
they did not follow the true religion neither did they understand the
Qur’an. They were rabble, rot, and deviants, and they were unbelievers in what was revealed to Muhammad about your
leadership, and they were supporters of those who antagonized you. While, Almighty Allah ordered everyone to follow you and
instructed the believers to support you. He, the Almighty and Allmajestic, has said in this respect: “O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah, and be with the truthful.” O master, through you
did the right manifest itself, but the people discarded it. And you
made clear the (Prophetic) traditions after they had been eradicated and confused. Hence, you enjoy the priority of struggling for the
sake of confirming the Divine Revelation, and you enjoy the virtue
of struggling for the sake of confirming the true interpretation (of the Divine Revelation). Your enemy is in fact the enemy of Allah and
the denier of Allah’s Messenger. Your enemy thus calls for vanity,
judges unfairly, usurps the position of rule, and drives his fans to
Hellfire. While Ammar (ibn Yasir) strove and called at the two parties
(of the battle): “How eager I am to join Paradise!” When he then
asked for a drink, he was served with a drink of milk; he thus
shouted, glorifying Allah, and said: “The Messenger of Allah – peace
of Allah be upon him and his Household – did say to me: ‘The last drink that you will have in this world is a cup of milk, and the
transgressing party will kill you.’” Thus, Abul-Adiyyah al-Fazaariyy
faced and killed him. The curse of Allah and the curse of all His
angels and Messengers be upon this Abul-Adiyyah, upon any one
who unsheathed a sword against you, and upon any one against
whom you unsheathed your sword – O Commander of the Faithful -
(Curse be upon) the polytheists and the hypocrites up to the Religion Day. Curse be also upon any one whom is pleased by
whatever upsets you, and curse be upon any one who is not passive
for whatever upsets you and upon any one who bypasses and does
not deny, and upon any one who supports your rivals by deeds or
words, and upon any one who fails to support you, and upon any
one who slackens to fight with you, and upon any one who despises
your merits, and upon any one who denies your right, and upon any
one who leaves you and joins one upon whom Almighty Allah has
given you priority. Allah’s peace, mercy, and blessings,
compliments, and greetings be upon you and upon the Imams from
your Immaculate Household. Verily, Allah is Praised and Glorious.
What is more astounding and more horrible than usurping your
right is the usurpation of Fadak from the veracious, pure, and
luminous Lady, the doyenne of the women of the world! As well as
the rejection of your testimony and the testimonies of the two
masters – your descendants, and the Household of the Chosen
Prophet, may Allah’s peace be upon you all. Whereas Almighty Allah
has elevated you in rank over the nation, raised your positions, and
demonstrated your preference and honorable favorability over all
the created beings. He thus removed away filth from you and
purified you with the most thorough purification. Allah the
Almighty and All-majestic says: “Indeed, man is created of a hasty
temperament. Being greatly grieved when evil afflicts him and
niggardly when good befalls him, except those who pray.” Hence,
Almighty Allah has excluded His Chosen Prophet you, the chief of
the Prophets’ successors, from among all His beings. How deviant
from the right he who has wronged you is! They then deceptively
decided the share of ‘Near of Kin’ to be for you, after they wrongly
deprived its meritorious people of it. When the matter (of rule) was
returned to you, you continued carrying out what they had decided,
because you desired for what is stored by Allah for you. Your
ordeals are thus similar to the ordeals encountered by the Prophets,
peace be upon them, who also faced loneliness and absence of
supporters. As you replaced the Prophet by spending that night on
his bed instead of him, this situation was similar to the situation of the self-sacrificing Prophet, peace be upon him. Because you
responded (to the Prophet’s order) in the same way as he (i.e. Prophet Ismail) responded (to his father’s request), and you obeyed
the Prophet in the same way as (Prophet) Ismail obeyed with steadfastness and reliance upon Allah. Hence, when his father said to him, ‘O my son! Surely, I have seen in a dream that I should
sacrifice you; consider then what you see.’ He said, ‘O my father! Do what you are commanded; if Allah please, you will find me of the
patient ones.’ The same situation with you, when the Prophet –peace be upon him and his Household – chose you to replace him, and ordered you to sleep in his bed instead of him so that you
should protect him by sacrificing yourself for him, you quickly responded to his request with obedience, by exposing yourself to
killing fearlessly. So, Allah the All-exalted appreciated this obedience to him and He, majestic be His mention, declared your
excellent deed by saying: “And among men is he who sells himself to seek the pleasure of Allah.” Then, your ordeal on the Battle of
Siffeen, when books of the Qur’an were raised (on spearheads) out of trickery and deception, causing doubt to be aroused, the truth to
be neglected, and conjecture to be followed, this ordeal was similar
to the ordeal of (Prophet) Aaron when (Prophet) Moses appointed
him as the leader of his people, but they left him alone, while
(Prophet) Aaron was calling at them, saying: ‘O my people! You are
only tried by it, and surely your Lord is the Beneficent Allah.Therefore, follow me and obey my order.’ They said, ‘We will by no
means cease to keep to its worship until Moses returns to us.’
Similarly, when the books of the Qur’an were raised (on
spearheads), you said: ‘O my people, you are only tried by this and you have been surely cheated.’ Nevertheless, they disobeyed you
and did the opposite. And when they demanded with nominating
two arbitrators (one from each party), you rejected and declared
your disavowal of this act before Allah, and then asked them to do
whatever they wanted. Thus, when the truth manifested itself the
wrong was proven as futile, and they confessed of their flaw and
deviation from the right thing, they also mutinied after that and
obliged you to commit to the nonsensical result of the arbitration
that you had rejected and they had accepted, and you had forbidden it, and they then confessed of the sin that they had
committed. While you were following the course of sagacity and true guidance, they were following the courses of deviation and
blindness. Nonetheless, they insisted on hypocrisy and involved
themselves in seduction until Allah made them taste the evil result
of their conduct. He thus deadened, through your sword, those who
mutinied against you, causing them eternal misery and perdition,
and He gave life, through your acting as His argument, to those
whom He decided as happy; therefore, they were guided (to the true choice). Allah’s blessings be upon you, coming and going, and still
and moving. Certainly, no one praising you can ever cover your
actual characteristics and no one criticizing you can ever belittle
your merits. You are verily the best worshipper of all created beings,
the most sincere in asceticism, and the most enthusiastic defender
of the religion. You executed the laws of Allah with exceptional
efforts and damaged the armies of the apostates with your sword.
You can extinguish the flames of battles with your finger, tear out
the curtains of seditions with your eloquent language, and distinguish the confusing wrong from the plain right. You are never
influenced by any censure as long as you work for the sake of Allah.
The praising of Allah the All-exalted to you suffices from the
praising of any other one and from the approval of the depicters.
Almighty Allah says: “Of the believers are men who are true to the covenant which they made with Allah. So, of them is he who
accomplished his vow, of them is he who yet waits, and they have
not changed in the least.” After you felt that you had killed the
preachers, the wrongdoers, and the apostates, the predictions of
Allah’s Messenger – peace be upon him and his Household – came
true, and you had fulfilled your promise to him, you then said: “Has
time not come yet so that this (beard) shall be dyed with the blood
of this (head)? When will the most unfortunate of them be sent (to
slay me)?” You were always confident that you were proceeding on clear proof from your Lord, you were acting with sure knowledge of
what you do, you were on your way to Allah, and you were rejoicing
in the bargain that you had made with Him; and that is the supreme
triumph. O Allah, curse the murderers of your Prophets and the
murderers of Your Prophets’ successors with the variant curses (that You have prepared for them), and make those slayers to taste the
heat of Your fire. And also curse those who usurped the right of
Your friend, those who denied their allegiance to him, and those
who rejected him after they had witnessed and declared their
loyalty to him on the day when you completed your religion
through him. O Allah, curse those who slew the Commander of the
Faithful, curse those who wronged him, and curse their adherents
and supporters. O Allah, curse those who wronged and slew alHusayn, and curse those who adhered to his enemies and those who supported them, and curse those who were pleased by the murder
of killing al-Husayn and those who disappointed him, with violent
cursing. O Allah, curse the first one to invent the wronging against
the Household of Muhammad and curse those who deprived them
of their rights. O Allah, pour violent curses upon the first one who
wronged and usurped the rights of the Household of Muhammad,
and curse all those who followed those wrongdoers up to the
Resurrection Day. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad, the
seal of the Prophets, and upon Ali, the chief of the Prophets’
successors, and upon his immaculate Household, (please do) make us adhere to them firmly, and include us with those who shall be
winners and secured because they abode by their leadership; those
upon whom there shall come no fear, nor shall they grieve.

After this, again cling to the grave, kiss it and say:

dress, apply perfume and walk with demeanor. When you reach

that you, being Allah’s friend and argument, strove in Allah’s way in
the most appropriate way, followed the course of Allah’s
Messenger, peace be upon him and his Household, enjoined that
which Allah has deemed lawful, forbade that which Allah has
deemed unlawful, carried out His laws, offered the prayers, paid the
zakat, enjoined the right, forbade the wrong, and strove in Allah’s
way with steadfastness and well-wishing, and with painstakingness
and with the intention of seeking the great reward of Allah until
death came upon you. So, Allah’s curse be upon those who deprived
you of your right and upon those who took you away from your
position. Allah’s curse be upon every one who, when informed
about this, accepted it. I call Allah, His angels, His Prophets, and His
Messengers to witness for me that I am the friend of him who is loyal to you and the enemy of him who antagonizes you. Peace and
Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you.

After this cling to the grave and kissing it say

I bear witness that you can hear my words and see my place. And I
testify to you, O Allah’s friend, that you conveyed and fulfilled. O my
master! O Allah’s argument! O Allah’s trustee! O Allah’s friend!
Between me and Allah, to Whom all might and majesty belong,
there are sins that have overburdened my back and deprived me of sleep; whenever I remember them, even my insides shiver. I thus
flee to Allah, to Whom all might and majesty belong, and to you. I
beg you in the name of Him Who has entrusted you with His secrets,
appointed you as the supervisor over the affairs of His creatures,
matched the obedience to you to the obedience to Him, and
matched the loyalty to you to the loyalty to Him that you may
intercede for me before Allah, rescue me from Hellfire, and aid me
against the vicissitudes of my time.

After this, again cling to the grave, kiss it and say:

O Allah’s friend! O Allah’s argument! O Allah’s door of forgiveness! I,
your adherent, visitor, seeker of refuge with your tomb, residing in
your courtyard, staying in your vicinity, (I) beg you to intercede for
me before Allah that He may grant my needs and may respond to
my requests for this life as well as the life to come, because you
enjoy an enormous position with Allah, as well as admitted right of
intercession. So, O my master, include me with those for whom you care and include me with your party. Peace be upon you and upon
your partners in place; Adam and Noah. Peace be upon you and
upon your two sons; al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and upon the immaculate Imams from your progeny. Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you.

First: Ziarat-e-Rajabia
الْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذي اَشْهَدَنا مَشْهَدَ اَوْلِيائِهِ في رَجَب، وَاَوْجَبَ عَلَيْنا مِنْ حَقِّهِمْ ما قَدْ وَجَبَ، وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلى مُحَمَّد الْمُنْتَجَبِ، وَعَلى اَوْصِيائِهِ الْحُجُبِ، اَللّـهُمَّ فَكَما اَشْهَدْتَنا مَشْهَدَهُمْ فَاَنْجِزْ لَنا مَوْعِدَهُمْ، وَاَوْرِدْنا مَوْرِدَهُمْ، غَيْرَ مُحَلَّئينَ عَنْ وِرْد في دارِ الْمُقامَةِ والْخُلْدِ، وَالسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ اِنّي قَصَدْتُكُمْ وَاعْتَمَدْتُكُمْ بِمَسْأَلَتي وَحاجَتي وَهِيَ فَكاكُ رَقَبَتي مِنَ النّارِ، وَالْمَقَرُّ مَعَكُمْ في دارِ الْقَرارِ مَعَ شيعَتِكُمُ الاَْبْرارِ، وَالسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ بِما صَبَرْتُمْ فَنِعْمَ عُقْبَى الدّارِ، اَنَا سائِلُكُمْ وَآمِلُكُمْ فيـما اِلَيْكُمُ التَّفْويضُ، وَعَلَيْكُمْ التَّعْويضُ فَبِكُمْ يُجْبَرُ الْمَهيضُ وَيُشْفَى الْمَريضُ، وَما تَزْدادُ الاَْرْحامُ وَما تَغيضُ، اِنّي بِسِرِّكُمْ مُؤْمِنٌ، وَلِقَوْلِكُمْ مُسَلِّمٌ، وَعَلَى اللهِ بِكُمْ مُقْسِمٌ في رَجْعي بِحَوائِجي وَقَضائِها وَاِمْضائِها وَاِنْجاحِها وَاِبْراحِها، وَبِشُؤوني لَدَيْكُمْ وَصَلاحِها، وَالسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ سَلامَ مُوَدِّع، وَلَكُمْ حَوائِجَهُ مُودِعٌ يَسْأَلُ اللهَ اِلَيْكُمْ الْمَرْجِعَ وَسَعْيُهُ اِلَيْكُمْ غَيْرُ مُنْقَطِع، وَاَنْ يَرْجِعَني مِنْ حَضْرَتِكُمْ خَيْرَ مَرْجِع اِلى جَناب مُمْرِع، وَخَفْضِ مُوَسَّع، وَدَعَة وَمَهَل اِلى حينِ الاَْجَلِ، وَخَيْرِ مَصير وَمَحلٍّ، في النَّعيمِ الاَْزَلِ، وَالْعَيْشِ الْمُقْتَبَلِ وَدَوامِ الاُْكُلِ، وَشُرْبِ الرَّحيقِ وَالسَّلْسَلِ، وَعَلٍّ وَنَهَل، لا سَأمَ مِنْهُ وَلا مَلَلَ، وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ وَتَحِيّاتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ حَتّيَ الْعَوْدِ اِلى حَضْرَتِكُمْ، والْفَوزِ في كَرَّتِكُمْ، وَالْحَشْرِ في زُمْرَتِكُمْ، وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَصَلَواتُهُ وَتَحِيّاتُهُ، وَهُوَ حَسْبُنا وَنِعْمَ الْوَكيلُ

The author of ‘Mazaar-e-Qadeem’ and Shaykh Mohammad Mashadi (a.r.) consider this Ziyarat to be special for the eve of 27th Rajab. It is mentioned that after reciting this Ziyarat one should perform 2 rakats Namaz-e-Ziyarat and then ask for ones legitimate wishes.

Second Ziyarat 

اَلسَّلامُ عَلى اَبِي الْاَئِمَّةِ وَمَعْدِنِ النُّبُوَّة It is the 7th Ziyarat in the ‘Tohfa’ of Allamah Majlisi (r.a.). The author of ‘Mazaar-e-Qadeem’ says that it is special for the eve of 27th Rajab, as we have mentioned in the book of ‘Hadiyyat-uz-Zaaereen.’

Third
It is the Ziyarat mentioned by Shaykh Mufeed (r.a.), Sayyid (r.a.) and Shaheed (r.a.) in the following way: Whenever you want to recite the Ziyarat of Ameerul Momeneen (a.s.) on the eve of the 27th Rajab you must stand at the door of the Shrine and facing the grave recite as follows:

اَشْهَدُ اَنْ لا اِلـهَ اِلاَّ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لا شَريكَ لَهُ، وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، وَاَنَّ عَلِيَّ بْنَ اَبي طالِب اَميرَ الْمُؤمِنينَ عَبْدُ اللهِ، وَاَخُورَسُولِهِ، وَاَنَّ الْاَئِمَّةَ الطّاهِرينَ مِنْ وُلْدِهِ حُجَجُ اللهِ عَلى خَلْقِهِ

Then enter and go to the grave and stand facing it while your back is towards the Qibla. Recite الله اكبر 100 times and after that recite as follows:

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ آدَمَ خَليفَةِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ نُوح صَفْوَةِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ اِبْراهيمَ خَليلِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ مُوسى كَليمِ

للهِ وَاَعْظَمَهُمْ عَناءً، وَاَحْوَطَهُمْ عَلى رَسُولِ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ، وَاَفْضَلَهُمْ مَناقِبَ، وَاَكْثَرَهُمْ سَوابِقَ، وَاَرْفَعَهُمْ دَرَجَةً، وَاَشْرَفَهُمْ مَنِزْلَةً،

وَغَيْظِ الْكافِرينَ، وَضِغْنِ الْفاسِقينَ، وَقُمْتَ بِالْاَمْرِ حينَ فَشِلُوا، وَنَطَقْتَ حينَ تَتَعْتَعُوا، وَمَضَيْتَ بِنُورِ اللهِ اِذْ وَقَفُوا، فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَكَ فَقَدِ اهْتَدى، كُنْتَ اَوَّلَهُمْ كَلاماً، وَاَشَدَّهُمْ خِصاماً، وَاَصْوَبَهُمْ مَنْطِقاً، وَاَسَدَّهُمْ رَأياً، وَاَشْجَعَهُمْ قَلْباً، وَاَكْثَرَهُمْ يَقيناً، وَاَحْسَنَهُمْ عَمَلاً، وَاَعْرَفَهُمْ بِالْاُمُورِ، كُنْتَ لِلْمُؤْمِنينَ اَباً رَحيماً اِذْ صارُوا عَلَيْكَ عِيالاً، فَحَمَلْتَ اَثْقالَ ما عَنْهُ ضَعُفُوا، وَحَفِظْتَ ما اَضاعُوا، وَرَعَيْتَ ما اَهْمَلُوا، وَشَمَّرْتَ اِذْ جَبَنُوا، وَعَلَوْتَ اِذْ هَلِعُوا، وَصَبَرْتَ اِذْ جَزِعُوا، كُنْتَ عَلَى الْكافِرينَ عَذاباً صَبّاً وَغِلْظَةً وَغَيْظاً، وَلِلْمُؤْمِنينَ غَيْثاً وَخِصْباً وَعِلْماً، لَمْ تُفْلَلْ حُجَّتُكَ، وَلَمْ يَزِغْ قَلْبُكَ، وَلَمْ

Then kiss the shrine and place your right cheek upon it then place your left cheek upon it and turn towards the Qibla and pray 2 rakats namaz. After the namaz ask whatever Dua you like and then recite the Tasbeeh of Hazrat Fatemah Zahra (s.a.). After the Tasbeeh recite:

with them and do not include us with those whom shall be
prevented from drinking from the (Divine) Pool in the abode of
eternity and perpetuity. And peace be upon you all. I have turned
my face towards you and directed to you carrying my query and
need with me, which is the release of my neck from Hellfire and the
settlement with you in the Abode of Settlement, with your pious
adherents (Shi’ah). And peace be upon you all for that you
persevered in patience. Now how excellent is the final home! I hereby beg you and put my hope in you as regards the matters in
which you have the right to act and recompense. Truly, through you
only are the hopeless restored (to good condition) and through you
only are the ailed healed and that which the wombs absorb and that
which they grow. Verily, I have full faith in your Secret and I am fully
submissive to your words and I thus ask you by Allah to settle,
respond to, give success to, and set aright all my needs and all my
affairs towards you. Peace be upon you from one who bids you
farewell and puts all his needs with you praying Allah for another
visit to you since his hope is never cut off from you. I also pray Him
to make my departure successful to a productive place, a fruitful
area, comfort, and luxurious up to the befalling of death; and also [I
pray Him] for the best destiny and abode in the Eternal Bliss, the
affluent living,the perpetual fruit, the drinking from the pure drink
and the divine spring whose drink is refreshing and thirstquenching that is never bored or fed up. Allah’s mercy, blessings and salutations be upon you incessantly until I return to your

We should know that Kufa is one of the four cities selected by Allah and He has meant Kufa only by Tur-e-Sineen and it is mentioned in traditions that it is the Sanctuary of Allah, the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and Ameerul Momineen (a.s.). To give a Dirham in Sadaqah here is equivalent to giving 100 dirhams. To pray 2 rakats prayer herein is equal to 100 rakats Namaz.
Virtues of Masjid-e-Kufa

The virtues of Masjid-e-Kufa are too much. It is sufficient for its merit to say that it is one of those four Masjids, traveling towards whom is recommended to obtain their benefits. It is also one of those places where the traveler has the option to either pray full or shortened (qasr) namaz. To pray obligatory prayers here is equal to an accepted Hajj and like praying 1000 prayers at other places. It is mentioned in narrations that it is the place of the prayers of the Prophets (a.s.) and Imam Mahdi (a.t.f.s.) will also pray here. According to traditions 1000 prophets and 1000 legatees have prayed in this mosque. Some narrations show that the Mosque of Kufa is superior to the Aqsa Mosque of Baitul Muqaddas. Ibne Quluwayh (r.a.) has related from Imam Mohammad Baqir (a.s.) that he said:
If people come to know the merit of Masjid-e-Kufa they would travel towards it from far-off places. The reward of obligatory prayer in this Masjid is equal to that of an accepted Hajj and the reward of Nafelah prayer is equal to that of an accepted Umrah.
Another tradition says that obligatory and nafelah prayers equal to Hajj and Umrah respectively performed with the Holy Prohpet (s.a.w.a.). Shaykh Kulayni (r.a.) and other great scholars have related from Haroon bin Kharja that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said,
“O Haroon, what is the distance between you and Masjide-Kufa? It could be one mile?”
“No,” he replied.
“Do you recite all your obligatory prayers in it?”
“No”. Imam (a.s.) said:
“If I had been near this Mosque I would have recited all my obligatory prayers therein. Do you know how much meritorious it is? No prophet or a righteous person has passed who has not recited prayer in it. So much so that when the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) was taken on Me’raj, Jibraeel (a.s.) said to him: Do you know where you are right now? You are in front of the Kufa mosque. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) said, ‘Then ask Allah on my behalf so that I can go there and perform 2 rakats namaz.’ Jibraeel sought Allah’s permission and Allah gave the permission. The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) descended and prayed 2 rakats namaz in this Mosque. Indeed to the right side of it is a garden of the Paradise and between it is a garden of Paradise to the back of it is also a garden of Paradise. Indeed praying an obligatory prayer here is equal to praying 1000 prayers and the reward of Nafelah prayer is equal to 500 prayers. To sit there even without reciting any devotions is worship. If people come to know the merits they would definitely reach it even if they have to crawl like infants.”
In another tradition, to perform obligatory prayer in it is equal to perform Hajj and recommended prayer is equal to perform Umrah. In the seventh Ziyarat of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.), virtues of this mosque are mentioned. According to some traditions the right side is more virtuous then the left.Aamal of Masjid-e-Kufa""",

Peace be on his ancestors Adam, Nuh, Ibrahim and Isma’il and on

truthful and the greatest one, the one who judges with justice
through whom Allah distinguishes between truth and falsehood,
and between disbelief and true belief, polytheism and monotheism
so that those who are destroyed are destroyed after clear signs were
delivered to them. Those who are revived are revived due to clear signs to them. I bear witness that you are the Commander of the
Faithful especially for the souls of the chosen ones and an ornament
of the truthful ones and patience for those tried. I bear witness that
you are the command of Allah on His earth, one who implements His
commands; you are the door to His wisdom; undertaker of His
covenant and you speak by His promise. You are the rope that is
connected between Him and His slaves. You are the cave of
salvation and the path of righteousness, the highest level of
uprightness and the greatest judge. O Commander of the Faithful,

This is a very important pillar. Hazrat Ali (a.s.) used to pray here. It is the place where Allah had accepted the repentance of Hazrat
Adam (a.s.).

First face the Qibla and then recite the following Dua:

In the name of Allah, by Allah and on the path of the Prophet of
Allah, peace be on him and his family. There is no god but Allah,
Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah. Peace be on our father Adam
and on our mother Hawaa and on Habil, the one who was killed
unjustly due to enmity. Peace be on the gifts of Allah and His pleasures. Peace be on Sheesh, the chosen one of Allah and the
trustworthy one and on the truthful, pure ones from his pure
progeny, the first and last ones. Peace be on Ibrahim, Isma’il, Ishaq,
Ya’qub and on their progeny, the chosen ones. Peace be on Musa,
the one who spoke to Allah. Peace be on ‘Isa, the spirit of Allah.
Peace be on Muhammad b. ‘Abd Allah, the seal of the Prophets.
Peace be on the Commander of the Faithful and his pure progeny,
may the mercy and blessings of Allah be on them. Peace be on you
at the beginning, peace be on you at the end. Peace be on Fatima
Az-Zahra, peace be on the Imams, the guides bearing witness to
Allah on His creatures. Peace be on the watchers, ones who bear
witness on the nations for Allah, the Lord of the Universe. 

After this recite 4 rakats prayer in units of 2 rakats each. In the first
rakat after surah Hamd recite surah Qadr, in the second rakat after
surah Hamd recite surah Tawheed, third and fourth rakats should
also be prayed in the same way. After Tasbeeh of Hazrat Fatemah
Zahra (s.a.) recite the following dua. 

O my Allah, if I have disobeyed You then I have obeyed by my
complete faith in You, bestow Your favors on me for I cannot do
favors to You. I have obeyed You in the things You love most. I do
not attribute a son to You nor do I associate a partner with You. I
have disobeyed You in many things without being arrogant or
denying worship to You nor denying Your Lordship. But I followed
my desires and Shaitan misguided me even though I had clear
proofs and signs. If You punish me then it will be due to my sins. You
will not be unjust to me. If You forgive me and have mercy on me
then it will be due to Your generosity and nobility, O noble one. O
my Allah, there is no recourse in my sins except hope in Your forgiveness. 

I have come with the tools of depravity so I ask You, O
Allah, what I do not deserve and I seek from You what I am not
worthy of. O Allah, if You punish me it will be due to my sins and
You will not have wronged me at all but if You forgive me it will be
because You are the most merciful, O my master. O Allah, You are
what You are and I am what I am. You are the one who repeatedly
forgives, I am one who repeatedly sins. You are the one who
bestows forbearance whereas I return to ignorance. O Allah, I ask
You, O One who is the treasury of the weak ones, O mighty in hopes.
O One who saves those who drown, O One who saves those who are
destroyed, O One who takes away life and O One who gives life to
those who are dead. You are Allah there is no god but You. You are
the one to whom the rays of the sun bow down, tire reverberation of the water, the rustling of the trees and the light of tire moon, the
darkness of the night, the brightness of the day and tire fluttering of the birds submit to You. So I ask You. 

O Allah, O most great by Your right on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his truthful family and by the
right of Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his family on You. I ask You by
Your right on Ali (a.s.) and by the right of Ali (a.s.) on You and I ask
You by Your right on Fatima (s.a.) and by the right of Fatima (s.a.) on
You. I ask You by Your right on al-Hasan (a.s.) and by the right of alHasan (a.s.) on You. I ask You by Your right on al-Husain (a.s.) and
the right of al-Husain (a.s.) on You. Indeed, their rights are due to
Your great blessings on them and due to the status they enjoy in
front of You. Send Your blessings on them, O Lord, with eternal
blessings and Your utmost pleasure. So, because of them, forgive
the sins that come between You and me. Make Your creatures
happy with me and perfect Your blessings on me just as You did to
my ancestors before. Do not make any of Your creatures favor me.
Bestow Your favors on me just as You bestowed favors on my
ancestors before. O Qaf, Ha, Ya, Ain, Sad. O Allah, as You send
blessings on Muhammad (s.a.w.a.) and his family, so answer my
prayers concerning what I have asked of You, O Noble One. O Noble
One, O Noble One. O Noble One. 

Go into the Sajdah and say:

O one who has power over the needs of those who ask and knows
what is the minds of those who are quiet, O one who does not
require explanation, O one who recognizes the deception of the
eyes and what the hearts conceal. O one who sent down punishment on the people of Yunus when He wanted to punish
them. They implored and beseeched Him and He removed the punishment and let them live. O Allah, You have seen my position
and heard my supplications and know my private and my public life
and my circumstances. Send Your blessings on Muhammad and the family of Muhammad and remove what troubles me in the affairs of my religion, my world and in my hereafter.

Then repeat 70 times: O my master.

Sit up after the Sajdah and say: O Lord, I ask You for the blessings of this place and the blessings of
its people. I ask You to bestow on me sustenance that is halaal and
pure, by Your power and might, I ask for good health, O most
merciful of the merciful ones.""",

اللّهمَّ إن عَظُيمَ الذّنبُ منَ عَبدِك فَلْيَحْسُن العَفْوُ مِنْ عِنْدِك ياكريم

            """The author of Mafaateehul Jenaan says: In some unauthentic
books which are known among the people, it is narrated that at
this place one should perform that act which Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) has taught to some of his companion. But this act does not
have any preference at this place. It is narrated from Imam Jafar
Sadiq (a.s.) that he told one of his companions:

When you have any need and if you pass by the Kufa
Mosque then recite 4 rakats of Namaz and after it recite
this dua:

“O my Allah, if I have disobeyed You then I have obeyed by my
complete faith in You, bestow Your favors on me for I cannot do
favors to You. I have obeyed You in the things You love most. I do
not attribute a son to You nor do I associate a partner with You. I
have disobeyed You in many things without being arrogant or
denying worship to You nor denying Your Lordship. But I followed
my desires and Shaitan misguided me even though I had clear
proofs and signs. If You punish me then it will be due to my sins. You
will not be unjust to me. If You forgive me and have mercy on me
then it will be due to Your generosity and nobility, O noble one

Then say:

However, the Shaykh Shaheed (r.a.) and Mohammad Mashhadi
(r.a.) has related this Aamal after the Aamal of the fourth pillar for
the courtyard of the Masjid. In 2 rakats recite surah Hamd and
surah Tawheed and in the next 2 rakats recite surah Hamd and
surah Qadr and after the Salaam, the Tasbeeh of Fatemah Zahra
(s.a.) is mentioned.

It is related by Abu Hamza Sumali (r.a.) in reliable tradition that he
said: I was sitting in the Kufa Masjid. Suddenly I saw that a person
entered the Masjid from Daar-e-Kunda. He was extremely
handsome and he was elegantly dressed and wore a nice perfume
also. He had a turban over his head, a long dress and had Arab
shoes on his feet. He slipped off his shoes and went to stand near
the seventh pillar. He raised his hands to his ears and recited the
Takbeer. Every hair of his body stood up due to fear. He recited 4
rakats namaz. He performed the rukus and Sajdahs in the best way
and then recited this dua: ILAHI IN KUNTO KAD ASAITAK

When he reached (YA KAREEMO) he went into Sajdah and
went on repeating (YA KAREEMO) and then recited (YAA SAYYEDEE) 70 times as mentioned in the Aamals of the seventh
pillar. When he raised his head from the Sajdah, I saw that he was Imam Zainul Aabedeen (a.s.). I kissed his blessed hand and said:
Why have you come here?

For the thing that you saw, that is to pray in the Kufa Masjid.
The narration we have quoted for the Seventh Ziyarat says that he
took Abu Hamza Sumali for the Ziyarat of Ameerul Momineen(a.s.).""",

path of those who strive in His way until you met Allah, the most powerful, majestic. He was pleased with you. 

I bear witness that you were loyal to the covenant of Allah and that you gave your life in
helping the proof of Allah and the son of His proof until death
overtook you. I bear witness that you submitted and were faithful
and gave proper advice to the descendant of the Prophet, the
Messenger and the chosen grandson, the universal guide and
successor who proclaimed, he was the one oppressed and wronged.

May Allah reward you on behalf of His Prophet and on behalf of the

possible reward for your patience and help; the best abode is the
abode of the hereafter. May Allah curse those who killed you and
those who commanded others to kill you. May Allah curse those
who wronged and fabricated lies against you. May Allah curse those
who were ignorant of your rights and made light of your status. May

against you and did not help you. Praise be to Allah who made hell
their abode and an evil place for them. I bear witness that you were
killed oppressed and that Allah will reward you as He has promised
you. I have come to visit you, acknowledging your status,
submitting to you and following your practices. My help to you is
ready until Allah judges, for He is the best of judges. I am with you,
with you, not with your enemies. May the blessings and mercy of
Allah be on you and on your souls and bodies when you are present
and absent. May the peace, mercy and blessings of Allah be on you.

those in His authority. I bear witness that you excelled in giving
sound advice and strove to the utmost extent so much so that Allah
raised you to the status of the martyrs and gathered your soul with

            """After the Masjid of Kufa, the most significant and honorable is the
Sahla Masjid. This Masjid had been the residence of Janab-e-Idrees
(a.s.) and Janab-e-Ibraahim (a.s.). Janab-e-Khizr (a.s.) used to
frequent this place and according to the tradition of Imam Jafar
Sadiq (a.s.) after the reappearance, it would be the residence of
Hazrat Vali-ul-Asr (a.t.f.s.). He would stay therein with his family. All
the prophets have recited namaz in this Masjid. To stay in this
Masjid is like staying in the tent of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) with
him. This is the place where Allah desires that morning and
evening His name is exalted. The prime time for this Masjid is
Wednesday eve

In this mosque it is recommended to pray 2 rak’ats prayer between Maghrib and Isha. As Imam Sadiq (a.s.) has said:

If any sorrowful person will pray this namaz, Allah will ward off his sorrow. 

(1)In some books of ziyarat it is mentioned that if you intend
to enter the mosque, stand at the gate of the mosque and recite the following Dua:

In the name of Allah, by Allah, from Allah and to Allah and whatever
Allah wills, all the best names are for Allah. I depend on Allah, there
is no power nor might except with Allah, the most High, most Great.
O Allah, make me amongst those who build Your mosques and
houses. O Allah, I have turned to You by Muhammad and his family
and through them, I present my desires. So make me O Allah, due to
them, a notable person in Your eyes in this and the next world.
Make me amongst those close to You. O Allah, due to them, accept
my prayers and supplications. Forgive my sins because of them.
Make my sustenance vast due to them. Because of them, accept my
deeds and look kindly on me O most notable one so that I deserve
Your honor. Then never turn away from me by Your mercy, O most merciful one. O one who over-turns the hearts and sights,
strengthen my heart on Your path and that of Your Prophet and
friends. Do not turn my heart away [from You] having guided me
and bestow mercy on me from You, for You are most giving; O Allah,
I turn to You and I seek Your pleasure and reward. I believe in You, I
depend on You. O Allah, turn to me and make me turn towards You.

Then recite Ayatul Kursi, surah Falaq, surah Naas, then recite

Tasbihaat-e-Arba seven times as follows: 

Glory be to Allah and all Praise is for Allah and there is no god except Allah and Allah is greatest.

And after that recite the following Dua. 

O Allah, praise be to You due to Your guidance and that You
elevated me. Praise be to You due to Your honoring me, praise be to
You due to every good trial which You have tried me by. O Allah,
accept my prayers and supplications; purify my heart and expand
my chest and turn towards me for You are indeed most forgiving and merciful

(2)After praying the Maghrib Namaz and its Naafelah, recite 2 rakat namaz for the honoring of the Masjid. After that raise your hands and recite the following Dua:

You are Allah, there is no god but You; the originator of creation
and one who returns them, there is no god but You. The Creator of
all things and their sustainer; there is no god but You O one who
takes and gives You are Allah, there is no god but You who reckons
affairs and raises those in graves. You cause to inherit those on
earth. So I ask You by Your name which is hidden. O ever-living and
ever-lasting. You are Allah, there is no god but You; You know what is hidden and concealed. I ask You, O Allah, through Your name by
which, when You are asked, You answer and when asked to give,
You do give. I ask You by Your rights on Muhammad and his family
and by their rights on You which You have imposed on Yourself. I
ask that You send Your blessings on Muhammad and his family and
that You fulfill my needs soon. O One who hears supplications, O my
master, O my guardian, O helper. I ask You by every name that You
have named Yourself with, or which You taken for Yourself with the
hidden knowledge that You have send Your blessings on
Muhammad and his family and hasten to remove our difficulties and
fulfill our needs.

After the Dua, go into Sajdah and Supplicate Allah fervently.

(3)Pray two rakat namaz at the place of Ibrahim (a.s.). After the
namaz recite the Tasbeeh of Fatemah Zahra (s.a.) and after
this recite the following Dua

O Allah, by the right of this honorable place; by the rights of those
who worshipped You here. You know my needs, so send Your
blessings on Muhammad and his family and fulfill them. You have
counted my sins so send Your blessings on Muhammad and his
family and forgive my sins. O Allah, grant me life as long as it is good for me and take me away when death is better for me. Make
me befriend Your friends and be an enemy to Your enemies. Deal
with me according to what is most worthy of You, O most merciful of
the merciful ones.

(4)Recite 2 rakats namaz at the corner which is to the west and
towards the Qibla and after that raise up the hands and
recite the following Dua:

O Allah, I have offered these prayers seeking Your pleasures and
beseeching You, hoping for Your support and gifts, so bless
Muhammad and his family and accept the prayers with the best
acceptance. O Allah, by Your mercy, fulfill my hopes and deal with
me according to what is most worthy of You. O most merciful of the merciful ones.

Go into the Sajdah and place each cheek on the ground in turn
and supplicate Allah.

(5) Recite 2 rakat namaz in the eastern corner. After the namaz raise the hands and recite this dua: 

O Allah, my sins and errors have tarnished me in front of You and
have not raised my voice in front of You neither have they led to the
acceptance of my supplications, so I ask You. O Allah, there is no one
like You. I seek intercession through Muhammad and his family and
I ask You to send Your greetings to Muhammad and his family and
to turn to me by Your noble self and to accept my turning to You. Do
not disappoint me when I ask You nor deprive me when I place my
hopes in You, O most merciful of the merciful ones.

(6) After this recite 2 rakats namaz in the other corner in the west side and after the namaz recite the following dua:

O Allah, I ask You by Your name. O Allah, to send Your blessings on
Muhammad and his family and to make the best of my years the last
ones. Make the best of actions to be the last ones and the best of my
days when I meet You, for You are powerful over all things. O Allah,
accept my supplications and hear my invocations, O most High and
great. O one who is most powerful and conquering. O ever-living
who does not die, send Your greetings on Muhammad and his family and forgive those sins that come between me and You. Do not disgrace me in public. Guard me with Your eye that does not
sleep, have mercy on me by Your power over me, O most merciful one. Send Your greetings on our master Muhammad and his pure family, O Lord of the Universe. 

(7) Then recite 2 rakats namaz in the center of the masjid and then recite the following Dua:

O one who is closer to me than my own veins. O one who does what
He wishes, O one who comes between a person and his heart, send
Your greetings on Muhammad and his family and come between us
and what troubles us, by Your power and might. O one who is
sufficient over everything but nothing is complete without Him.

O Allah, one who has ample favors, abundant blessings, vast mercy
and accumulated power. O one who grants vast blessings, great
gifts and gives in abundance. O one who is not described by
comparison, neither is He described by something equivalent, nor is
He overcome by a helper. O one who creates and sustains, O one
who inspires and makes other speak. O one who creates and
legislates, one who raises and elevates. O one who determines and
perfects, O one who fashions and perfects. O one who argues and proclaims, O one who bestows blessings and makes them abundant.

O one who gives and then increases it, one who grants and bestows.
O one who is elevated by His power so that no-one can imagine Him,
and one, who through His grace, is close yet beyond the thoughts of people; O one who is unique in His kingdom, there is nothing like Him in the kingdom of His sovereignty. He is alone in His bounties
and might. There is no opposition to Him in His mighty status.
Intricate and delicate imaginations are bewildered in awe of His
majesty, the eyes of the people withdraw, dazzled by His grandeur.
O one to whom the faces have submitted due to His grandeur, necks have bowed due to His greatness and the hearts tremble due to His
fear. I ask You by these praises which no one but You deserve and
which You have stored with Yourself for those believers who ask. I ask You by that which You have promised to answer to those who
ask of You. O one who is the best of hearers and seers and one who
is quickest in accounting. O one who is most strong, send Your
blessings on Muhammad, the seal of the Prophets and his pure and
chosen family. Apportion for me in this month the best that You
have apportioned and, in Your decree, make my outcome the best
of all outcomes. Perfect my affairs in the most prosperous manner
and make me live the life of success and make me die in the state of happiness, having been forgiven. Oversee and ensure my salvation,
from the questions posed in Barzakh. Help me from Munkar and
Nakir and show me the bringer of good news. Direct me towards
that which earns me Your pleasure, making my life happy with much
wealth; send Your blessings on Muhammad and his family in the morning and evening.""",

perform the ritual bath (Ghusl) as Imam Sadiq (a.s.) taught
to Safwan, which we would mention in the discussion on
the 7th Ziyarat. Shaykh Mohammad bin Mashadi has
mentioned in the prefaces to the Ziyarats of two Eids that
when you decide to perform the Ziyarat of Imam (a.s.) you
must keep three fasts and perform the Ghusl on the third
day and then gather your family members around you and
recite as follows: 

اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي اَسْتَوْدِعُكَ الْيَوْمَ نَفْسي وَاَهْلي وَمالي وَوَلَدي وَكُلَّ مَنْ كانَ مِنّي بِسَبيل، الشّاهِدَ مِنْهُمْ وَالْغائِبَ، اَللّـهُمَّ احْفَظْنا بِحِفْظِكَ بِحِفْظِ الاِْيمانِ وَاحْفَظْ عَلَيْنا، اَللّـهُمَّ اجْعَلْنا في حِرْزِكَ وَلا تَسْلُبْنا نِعْمَتَكَ وَلا تُغَيِّرْ ما بِنا مِنْ نِعْمَة وَعافِيَة، وَزِدْنا مِنْ فَضْلِكَ اِنّا اِلَيْكَ راغِبُونَ 

Then leave your home with humility and respect and continue to repeat

لا اِلـهَ اِلاَّ اللهُ وَاللهُ اَكْبَرُ وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ

Continue to praise Allah and send blessings on Mohammad and his Progeny and walk with demenour and patience. Traditions say that from each drop of perspiration of the visitor to the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.), the Almighty Allah creates 70000 angels who beg forgiveness on behalf of the Imam and his visitor till the day of Qiyamat.

2. It is related from Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) that when you go for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) you must go in a sorrowful way, your hair awry, smeared with dust and in a hungry and thirsty condition, as Imam (a.s.) was also martyred in this condition. And ask for your legitimate needs and come back from there, do not make it your hometown.

3. Do not carry with you delicacies like biryani, sweets etc. as provisions of the journey when you travel for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.). You should instead have plain meals like bread and milk or bread and curd. 

It is related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that he said:
I have heard that some people go for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) carrying delicious foods like roasted goats and sweets, while they go to the graves of their fathers and friends without these things.
In another reliable tradition it is mentioned that he (a.s.) told Mufazzal Ibne umar:

Perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) as it is better than not performing it and do not perform the Ziyarat as it is better than performing it.
Mufazzal said: Your honour has broken my back. He (a.s.) said:

By Allah, when you visit the graves of your fathers you do it in a sorrowful condition and when you go for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) you carry with yourself different types of food and sweets, while you should go smeared with dust and with your hair disheveled.

The writer says: How nice it would be if in this journey, affluent and business people follow these things and in the journey to Kerbala they do not accept the invitation of any friend and they do not accept the gifts of roasted chicken and biryani etc. They should clearly say that they are travelers to Kerbala and such delicacies are not suitable for them. Shaykh Kulaini (r.a.) has reported that after the martyrdom of Imam Husain (a.s.) his wife Kalbiya arranged a Majlis, she herself wept and all the women and servants also wept till their tears dried up. A gift was sent to this lady from somewhere containing a chicken dish that would enable them to regain strength for weeping more. The lady asked: What is it? People said that such and such person has sent it so that you may be helped in the mourning of Imam (a.s.). She replied:
لَسْنا في عُرْس فَما نَصْنَعُ بِها

We are not in a gathering of wedding celebration. What do we have to do with such delicacies? Then she ordered that it be taken out of the house.

4. It is recommended that during the journey for Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) we must be in all humility and respect and travel like a lowly slave. Thus those who travel in modern vehicles should take care that they are not afflicted with pride and compare themselves to the poor pilgrims who trek and trudge for the Ziyarat. They should not consider them lowly. The scholars have mentioned in details about the people of the cave that they were special subjects of king Dakyaanoos and they were like his ministers. But when the mercy of Allah favoured them they thought of Allah’s worship and their personal reformation. Thus they decided that their well-being was in secluding themselves from the people and take refuge in the cave to concentrate on the worship of Allah. So they mounted their horses and left the town. When they had traveled a distance of three miles, Tamleekha, one of their associates said:
 يا اِخْوَتاهُ جاءَتْ مَسْكَنَةُ الاْخِرَةِ وَذَهَبَ مُلْكُ الدُّنْيا اِنْزِلُوا عَنْ خُيُولِكُمْ وَامْشُوا عَلى اَرْجُلِكُمْ 


All of them dismounted and that day those great people covered a distance of seven farsakhs on foot, till their feet were injured and bleeding. Thus the visitors to this grave should keep these things in mind and should know that whoever displays humility in this journey would be exalted in status by Allah. So whoever goes forZiyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.), for each of his step Allah writes a thousand good deeds and erases a thousand sins and elevates his status in Paradise by a thousand grades. Thus when you reach the Furaat Canal, perform ghusl there and become barefooted and carry your footwear in your hands and walk like a humiliated slave.
5. If one sees that pilgrims on foot are tired and need some help one must give preference to their assistance and help them reach the destination. Beware! Do not consider them respectless and do not ignore their requests. Shaykh Kulaini (a.r.) has narrated a reliable tradition from Abu Haroon that he said: I was present with Imam Sadiq (a.s.) when he told those around him:
What has happened to you that you consider us lowly?

A person from Khorasan stood up and said: We seek Allah’s refuge that we should consider you lowly. Imam (a.s.) said:
Yes, you are also of those who have considered us unimportant and lowly.
The man said: I seek Allah’s refuge that I should consider you lowly. Imam (a.s.) said:
Woe on you, when you were with me at Johfa you did not pay heed to the person who was begging you to let him ride for a mile on your mount, “By Allah I am very tired.” By Allah you did not even look towards him and considered him lowly. One who considers a believer lowly has insulted us and dishonoured the Almighty.
The writer says: We have related a tradition from Ali bin Yaqtin in the ninth etiquette of Ziyarat. Though it is common for all Ziyarats, it is specially significant during the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.).Therefore it is most advisable that readers apply the same etiquette here.

6. It is narrated from the great Mohammad bin Muslim that he asked Imam Baqir (a.s.): When we go to the Ziyarat of your respected forefather, Husain Ibne Ali (a.s.) are we not like when we go for Hajj? ‘Yes’, said the Imam (a.s.). Then all those things that are necessary for a Haji pilgrim also applyhere? Imam (a.s.) said:
It is necessary that you behave with kindness with your co-travelers and except for kind words speak little. You must remember Allah much. Your dress should be clean and ritually pure. Perform the ghusl before entering the precincts. Send salawat on Mohammad and Aale Mohammad as much as possible. It is necessary that your avoid those things that do not befit you. Avoid the harmful things, be kind to those of your believing brothers, who are in problems. If you see that someone has exhausted the provisions of the journey you must help him and distribute your provision between him and yourself. Taqaiyyah is necessary for you, it is the basis of religion. It is compulsory to avoid the things prohibited by Allah. You must avoid fights, arguments and dispute that necessitate swearing. If you follow all these things you will get the full reward of Hajj and Umrah. You will become eligible for the reward from the One for Whom you have spent your money and separated from your family. You will return after having your sins forgiven and after achieving Allah’s pleasure.

7. In the chapter of the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.), Abu Hamza Somali (r.a.) has narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that when you reach the land of Nainawa you should remove your shoes. And till the time you stay there you must not apply oil, wear surma and eat meat.

8. You must perform ghusl with the water of Furaat as it is praised too much in traditions. In one tradition Imam Sadiq (a.s.) is quoted that one who does ghusl in Furaat and performs the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) would be purified of his sins as if he were born on that day even if he had major sins in his account. It is narrated that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) was asked: Many a times it is seen that when we go for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) it is very difficult for us to bathe due to cold climate etc? Imam (a.s.) said:
One who does ghusl in Furaat and performs the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) has unlimited merits written for him.

Bashir Dahan has narrated that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said:

One who goes for the Ziyarat of the grave of Imam Husain(a.s.) and does Wuzu or ghusl in Furaat, for each step thathe takes he would get the reward for a Hajj and Umrah.
In one tradition it is said that one should perform the ghusl in Furaat at the spot facing the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.). As told in traditions it is better that when we reach the Furaat we should recite 100 times اللهُ اَكْبَرُ  
100 times لا اِلـهَ اِلاَّ اللهُ and recite salawat 100 times.

9. When one decides to enter the precincts one should enter from the East as told by Imam Sadiq (a.s.) to Yusuf bin Kanasi.

10. It is mentioned in the tradition of Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) that  Imam Sadiq (a.s.) told Mufazzal Ibne Umar:
O Mufazzal when you reach the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) you should stand at the entrance of the shrine and recite the following words as in lieu of each word you would get a portion of divine mercy:

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ آدَمَ صَفْوَةِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ نُوح نَبِيِّ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ اِبْراهيمَ خَليلِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ مُوسى كَليمِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ عيسى رُوحِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ مُحَمَّد حَبيبِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ عَلِيِّ وَصِيِّ رَسُولِ اللهِ، اَلسّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ الحَسَنِ الرَّضِّي، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيكَ يا وارِثَ فاطِمَةَ بِنْتَ رَسُولِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الشَّهيدُ الصِّدّيقُ اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الْوَصِيُّ الْبارُّ الْتَّقِيُّ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَى الاَْرْواحِ الَّتي حَلَّتْ بِفِنائِكَ وَاَناخَتْ بِرَحْلِكَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى مَلائِكَةِ اللهِ الُْمحْدِقينَ بِكَ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ اَقَمْتَ الصَّلاةَ وَآتَيْتَ الزَّكاةَ وَاَمَرْتَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَنَهَيْتَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَعَبَدْتَ اللهَ مُخْلِصاً حَتّى اَتاكَ الْيَقينُ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ

Then go towards the grave and remember that for each step you take you would be rewarded equal to the person who baths in his blood on the path of Allah. When you reach the grave place your hand upon it and say:

 اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا حُجَّةَ اللهِ في اَرْضِهِ وَسَمائِهِ


Then turn your attention towards namaz. Whatever prayers you pray there you would be rewarded for them equal to the person who has performed a thousand Hajjs and Umrahs, freed a thousand slaves and rose up to fight jihad with a messenger a thousand times.

11. Abu Saeed Madaa-eni is reported to have said: I went to Imam Sadiq (a.s.) and asked: Shall I go for the Ziyarat of the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.)? Yes, the Imam replied.
Go for the Ziyarat of the son of the Prophet, who was the best of the righteous people. When you perform his Ziyarat you must stand at the head of the grave and recite the Tasbeeh of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) thousand times and recite 2 rakats Namaz at the feet, and in those 2 rakats after Surah Hamd recite surah Yasin and surah Rahman. If you do this you would be highly rewarded.
I said: Please teach me the Tasbeeh of Ali (a.s.) and Fatemah (a.s.). Imam (a.s.) said:

O Abu Saeed! The Tasbeeh of Ali is as follows:
سُبْحانَ الَّذي لا تَنْفَدُ خَزائِنُهُ، سُبْحانَ الَّذي لا تَبيدُ مَعالِمُهُ، سُبْحانَ الَّذي لا يَفْنى ما عِنْدَهُ، سُبْحانَ الَّذي لا يُشْرِكُ اَحَداً في حُكْمِهِ، سُبْحانَ الَّذي لاَ اضْمِحْلالَ لِفَخْرِهِ، سُبْحانَ الَّذي لاَ انْقِطاعَ لِمُدَّتِهِ، سُبْحانَ الَّذي لا اِلـهَ غَيْرُهُ

And the Tasbeeh of Fatemah (s.a.) is as follows:
سُبْحانَ ذِي الْجَلالِ الْباذِخِ الْعَظيمِ، سُبْحانَ ذِي الْعِزِّ الشّامِخِ الْمُنيفِ سُبْحانَ ذِي الْمُلْكِ الْفاخِرِ الْقَديمِ، سُبْحانَ ذِي الْبَهْجَةِ وَالْجَمالِ، سُبْحانَ مَنْ تَرَدّى بِالنُّورِ وَالْوِقارِ، سُبْحانَ مَنْ يَرى اَثَرَ الَّنمْلِ فِي الصَّفا وَوَقَعَ الطَّيْرِ فِي الْهَواءِ 

12. Recite your obligatory and Nafelah prayers near the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) because a prayer recited there would be accepted. Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) says: Try to perform your obligatory and Nafelah prayers in the sanctuary. Indeed tradition says that reciting obligatory prayers at the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) carries the reward of Hajj and reciting Nafelah prayers is as rewarding as Umrah. The writer says: In the tradition of Mufazzal the performance of Namaz in the holy precincts has been mentioned as very rewarding. It is related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) in a reliable tradition that one who perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) and recites 2 or 4 rakats near his grave, will have the reward of Hajj and Umrah written for him. And it is apparent from traditions that the Namaz-e-Ziyarat etc, should be recited behind the grave and above the head. However, if one recites it above the head one should stand a little behind so that one is not exactly opposite the actual grave. And it is mentioned in the tradition of Abu Hamza Sumaali (r.a.) that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) is reported to have said, ‘One should recite 2 rakats Namaz above the head. In the first rakat after surah Hamd recite Surah Yasin and in the second rakat after Surah Hamd recite Surah Yasin? If one wants one can also pray behind the grave, but at the headside it is better. After the prayer recite any other prayers. But this 2 rakat prayer is necessary to be recited at every grave that is visited. Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has narrated from Imam Mohammad Baqir (a.s.) that he told one person:
O so and so! Who stops you from it that whenever you have a need you go to the grave of Husain (a.s.) and recite4 rakats prayer and then pray for your needs? Doubtlessly, reciting obligatory prayer near him is equal to Hajj and reciting Nafelah prayer is equal to Umrah.

13. We should know that the best action in the Shrine of Imam Husain (a.s.) is Dua. Because the acceptance of prayers below his dome is one of the things bestowed by Allah in lieu of the martyrdom. The pilgrim should consider it in his favour and he must not be lazy in invocating, praying and weeping. Many meaningful duas have been recorded in connection with the Ziyarat of this Imam. If we had not intended conciseness here we would have related some of the duas. It is better to recite as much as possible from the duas of Sahifa Kamelah. We would mention a dua after Ziyarat-e-Jaameah at the end the of this chapter that can be recited in any Shrine. But we also give here a dua which is mentioned in connection with Ziyarat. The dua is as follows and one should recite it inside the shrine with hands raised to the sky:
اَللّـهُمَّ قَدْ تَرى مَكاني، وَتَسْمَعُ كَلامي، وَتَرى مَقامي وَتَضَرُّعي وَمَلاذي بِقَبْرِ حُجَّتِكَ وَابْنِ نَبِيِّكَ، وَقَدْ عَلِمْتُ يا سَيِّدي حَوائِجي وَلا يَخْفى عَلَيْكَ حالي، وَقَدْ تَوَجَّهْتُ اِلَيْكَ بِابْنِ رَسُولِكَ وَحُجَّتِكَ وَاَمينِكَ وَقَدْ اَتَيْتُكَ مُتَقَرِّباً بِهِ اِلَيْكَ وَاِلى رَسُولِكَ فَاجْعَلْني بِهِ عِنْدَكَ وَجيهاً فِي الدُّنْيا وَالاْخِرَةِ وَمِنَ الْمُقَرَّبينَ وَاَعْطِني بِزِيارَتي اَمَلي وَهَبْ لي مُناىَ وَتَفَضَّلْ عَلَيَّ بِشَهْوَتي وَرَغْبَتي وَاقْضِ لي حَوائِجي وَلا تَرُدَّني خائِباً وَلا تَقْطَعْ رَجائي وَلا تُخَيِّبْ دُعائي وَعَرِّفْنِى الاِْجابَةِ في جَميعِ ما دَعَوْتُكَ مِنْ اَمْرِ الدّينِ وَالدُّنْيا وَالاْخِرَةِ وَاجْعَلْني مِنْ عِبادِكَ الَّذينَ صَرَفْتَ عَنْهُمُ الْبَلايا وَالاَْمْراضَ وَالْفِتَنَ وَالاَْعْراضَ مِنَ الدّينَ تُحْييهِمْ في عافِيَة وَتُميتُهُمْ في عافِيَة وَتُدْخِلُهُمُ الْجَنَّةَ في عافِيَة وَتُجيرُهُمْ مِنَ النّارِ في عافِيَة وَوَفِّقْ لي بِمَنْ مِنْكَ صَلاحَ ما اُؤَمِلَّ في نَفْسي وَاَهْلي وَوُلْدي وَاِخْواني وَمالي وَجَميعِ ما اَنْعَمْتَ بِهِ عَلَيَّ يا اَرْحَمَ الرّاحِمينَ
O my Allah You takes notice of my position, hears whatever I say, understands my approach, my deep affection, and my "refugetaking" keenness for the "resting abode" of Your Proof, the son of Your prophet. O my Master, You knows what I want, my condition is not hidden from You, therefore, I turn to You, through Your Apostle's son, Your Proof and Your confidant, I seek Your and Your Apostle's nearness through him, so, on account of him, let me be respectable and dignified before You, in this world and in the Hereafter, and also let me be Your close attendant and fulfill my desires in return of my (this) visitation, make a present of my joys and delights, bestow upon me that which I passionately crave and long for, satisfy my wants and needs do not send me away disappointed, do not cut off my holes, do not reject my prayers, let acceptance of my supplications in the affairs of my religion and this world and the hereafter become apparent for me and include me among those of Your servants who have been kept safe from dangers, diseases, distress and disadvantages, (whom) You let live in peace and prosperity, let me die in complete tranquillity, and enter the Paradise in ecstasy, take refuge in Your sanctuary to avoid the flames of the Fire. Provide me with a steady welfare, as a favour, which I ardently desire for myself, my family, my children, my brothers, my possessions, and for all that which You has bestowed upon me, O the most Merciful of all who show mercy!

14. One of the aamals of the shrine of Imam Husain (a.s.) is to recite durood upon him, tradition says that one should stand behind the Imam near his shoulder and recite durood on the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and on Imam Husain (a.s.). Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (a.r.) has quoted this salawat in Misbaahuz Zaaereen in connection with a Ziyarat:
اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد، وَصَلِّ عَلى الْحُسَيْنِ الْمَظْلُومِ الشَّهيدِ، قَتيلِ الْعَبَراتِ، وَاَسيرِ الْكُرُباتِ، صَلاةً نامِيَةً زاكِيَةً مُبارَكَةً يَصْعَدُ اَوَّلُها وَلا يَنْفَدُ آخِرُها اَفْضَلَ ما صَلَّيْتَ على اَحَد مِنْ اَوْلادِ الاَْنْبِياءِ وَالْمُرْسَلينَ يا رَبَّ الْعالِمينَ، اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى الاِْمامِ الشَّهيدِ الْمَقْتُولِ الْمَظْلُومِ الَْمخْذُولِ، وَالسَّيِّدِ الْقائِدِ، وَالْعابِدِ الزّاهِدِ، والْوَصِيِّ الْخَليفَةِ الاِْمامِ الصِّدّيقِ الطُّهْرِ الطّاهِرِ الطَّيِّبِ الْمُبارَكِ، وَالرَّضِيِّ الْمَرْضِيِّ وَالتَّقِيِّ الْهادِي الْمَهْدِيِّ الزّاهِدِ الذّائِدِ الُْمجاهِدِ الْعالِمِ، اِمامِ الْهُدى سِبْطِ الرَّسُولِ، وَقُرَّةِ عَيْنِ الْبَتُولِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَسَلَّمَ، اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى سَيِّدي وَمَوْلايَ كَما عَمِلَ بِطاعَتِكَ وَنَهى عَنْ مَعْصِيَتِكَ وَبالَغَ في رِضْوانِكَ، وَاَقْبَلَ عَلى ايمانِكَ غَيْرَ قابِل فيكَ عُذْراً سِرّاً وَعَلانِيَةً يَدْعُو الْعِبادِ اِلَيْكَ، وَ يَدُلُّهُمْ عَلَيْكَ، وَقامَ بَيْنَ يَدَيْكَ يَهْدِمُ الْجَوْرَ بِالصَّوابِ، وَيُحْيِي السُّنَّةَ بِالْكِتابِ، فَعاشَ في رِضْوانِكَ مَكْدُوداً، وَمَضى عَلى طاعَتِكَ وَفي اَوْلِيآئِكَ مَكْدُوحاً، وَقَضى اِلَيْكَ مَفْقُوداً لَمْ يَعْصِكَ في لَيْلِ وَلا نَهار بَلْ جاهَدَ فيكَ الْمُنافِقينَ وَالْكُفّارَ، اَللّـهُمَّ فَاَجْزِهِ خَيْرَ جَزاءِ الصّادِقينَ الاَْبْرارِ، وَضاعِفْ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَذابَ وَلِقاتِليهِ الْعِقابَ، فَقَدْ قاتَلَ كَريماً وَقُتِلَ مَظْلُوماً وَمَضى مَرْحُوماً، يَقُولُ اَنَا ابْنُ رَسُولِ اللهِ مُحَمَّد، وَابْنُ مَنْ زَكّى وَعَبَدَ، فَقَتَلُوهُ بِالْعَمْدِ الْمُعْتَمَدِ قَتَلُوهُ عَلَى الاْيمانِ وَ اَطاعُوا في قَتْلِهِ الشَّيْطانَ وَلَمْ يُراقِبُوا فيهِ الرَّحْمنَ، اَللّـهُمَّ فَصَلِّ عَلى سَيِّدي وَمَوْلايَ صَلاةً تَرْفَعُ بِها ذِكْرَه وَتُظْهِرُ بِها اَمْرَهُ، وَتُعَجِّلُ بِها نَصْرَهُ، وَاخْصُصْهُ بِاَفْضَلِ قِسَمِ الْفَضائِلِ يَوْمَ الْقِيامَةِ وَزِدْهُ شَرَفاً في اَعَلى عِلِّيِّينَ، وَبَلِّغْهُ اَعَلى شَرَفِ الْمُكَرَّمينَ وَاَرْفَعْهُ مِنْ شَرَفِ رَحْمَتِكَ في شَرَفِ الْمُقَرَّبينَ في الرَّفيعِ الاَْعَلى، وَبَلِّغْهُ الْوَسيلَةَ وَالْمَنْزِلَةَ الْجَليلَةَ وَالْفَضْلَ وَالْفَضيلَةَ وَالْكِرامَةَ الْجَزيلَةَ، اَللّـهُمَّ فَاَجْزِهِ عَنّا اَفْضَلَ ما جازَيْتَ اِماماً عَنْ رَعِيَّتِهِ، وَصَلِّ عَلى سَيِّدي و مَوْلايَ كُلَّما ذُكِرَ، وَكُلَّما لَمْ يُذْكَرْ يا سَيِّدي و مَوْلايَ أدْخِلْني في حِزْبِكَ وَزُمْرَتِكَ، وَاِسْتَوْهِبْني مِنْ رَبِّكَ وَرَبّي فَاِنَّ لَكَ عِنْدَ اللهِ جاهاً وَقَدْراً وَمَنْزِلَةً رَفيعَةً، اِنْ سَأَلْتَ اُعْطيتَ وَاِنْ شَفَعْتَ شُفِّعْتَ اللهَ اللهَ في عَبْدِكَ وَمَوْلاكَ لا تُخَلِّني عِنْدَ الشَّدائِدِ وَالاَْهْوالِ لِسُوءِ عَمَلي وَقَبيحِ فِعْلي وَعَظيمِ جُرْمي، فَاِنَّكَ اَمَلي وَرَجائي وَثِقَتي وَمُعْتَمَدي وَوَسيلَتي اِلَى اللهِ رَبّي وَرَبِّكَ لَمْ يَتَوَسَّلِ الْمُتَوَسِّلُونَ اِلَى اللهِ بِوَسيلَة هِىَ اَعْظَمُ حَقاً وَلا اَوْجَبُ حُرْمَةً وَلا اَجَّلُ قَدْراً عِنْدَهُ مِنْكُمْ اَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ لا خَلَّفَنِىَ اللهُ عَنْكُمْ بِذُنُوبي وَجَمَعَني وَاِيّاكُمْ في جَنَّةِ عَدْن الَّتي اَعَدَّها لَكُمْ وَلاَِوْلِيائِكُمْ اِنَّهُ خَيْرُ الْغافِرينَ وَ اَرْحَمَ الرّاحِمينَ، اَللّـهُمَّ اَبْلِغْ سَيِّدي وَمَوْلايَ تَحِيَّةً كَثيرَةً وَسَلاماً، وَارْدُدْ عَلَيْنا مِنْهُ السَّلامِ اِنَّكَ جَوادٌ كَريمٌ، وَصَلِّ عَلَيْهِ كُلَّما ذُكِرَ السَّلامُ وَكُلَّما لَمْ يُذْكَرْ يا رَبَّ الْعالَمينَ


The writer says: We have quoted this Ziyarat in the Aamal of the day of Ashura. And at the end of the chapter we would quote onesalawat upon Hojaj-e-Taaherah (The Purified Proofs) (a.s.) and a short salawaat would also be quoted for Imam Husain (a.s.) and we must not omit reciting it.
15. Of the aamals of this Shrine Dua-e-Mazloom (Prayer of the oppressed) is also mentioned. That is, if one is oppressed one should recite this prayer inside the Shrine. The dua issuch that the Shaykh-e-Taaefah (r.a.) has mentioned it in “Misbaahul Mutahajjid” in the aamal of Friday and said: It is recommended that one recites this Dua-e-Mazloom near the grave of Abi Abdullah Al-Husain (a.s.). The dua is as follows:
 اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي اَعْتَزُّ بِدينِكَ وَاكْرُمُ بِهِدايَتِكَ وَفُلانٌ يُذِلُّني بِشَرِّهِ وَيُهينُني بِاَذِيَّتِهِ، وَيُعيبُني بِوَلاءِ اَوْلِيائِكَ، وَيَبْهَتُني بِدَعْواهُ، وَقَدْ جِئْتُ اِلى مَوْضِعِ الدُّعاءِ وَضَمانِكَ الاِْجابَةَ، اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد وَاَعْدني عَلَيْهِ السّاعَةَ السّاعَةَ

Then one should throw oneself on the grave and say:

مَوْلايَ اِمامي مَظْلُومٌ اسْتَعْدي عَلى ظالِمِهِ النَّصْرَ النَّصْرَ

16. In the aamals of this Shrine is that dua also which Ibne Fahd quoted in Uddatud Daaee from Imam Sadiq (a.s.). He says: If one is having some need to be asked from Allah (s.w.t.), one should stand near the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) and say:

 يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ تَشْهَدُ مَقامي وَتَسْمَعُ كَلامي وَاَنَّكَ حَيٌّ عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ تُرْزَقُ فَاسْأَلْ رَبَّكَ وَرَبِّي في قَضاءِ حَوائِجي

17. In aamal only it is mentioned that 2 rakats namaz must be recited in the Shrine near the holy head, in which surah Rahman and Tabarak is recited. Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) has narrated that one who performs this namaz would be rewarded equal to 25 accepted Hajjs performed with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.).

18. One of the aamal of this blessed grave is also Istekhara. The method is same as mentioned by Allamah Majlisi (r.a.). The actual narration is in the book “Qarbul Asnaad’ of Humairi (r.a.). He says: with correct chains it is narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that one who asks Allah for goodness in some affair a hundred times and standing near the head of Imam Husain (a.s.) he says: ALHAMDO LILLAAHE, WA ELAAHA ILLAL LAAHO, SUHBAANAL LAAHE and remembers Allah with this greatness and praises and glorifies Him as is His right and asks for goodness in this affair a hundred times, Allah will surely show him whatever is good in this affair and bring it before him. According to another tradition one should pray for goodness a hundred times in the following manner:
اَسْتَخيرُ اللهَ بِرَحْمَتِهِ خِيَرَةً فِي عافِيَة

19. Shaykh Abul Qasim Jafar Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that he said:
Whenever you do the Ziyarat of Abu Abdillah al-Husain (a.s.) except for speaking good keep quiet as the guarding angels come night and day to the angels who are present in the holy precincts and they shake hands with those angels, but due to intense lamentations they do not reply and they continue to weep and wait. Yet they fall silent at the time of Zawaal (afternoon) and Sunrise. Thus the guarding angels wait for the afternoon and sunrise, so that they can speak to them during these two times and ask them about the affairs of the heavens. But even in those times the Angels of the precincts do not talk, instead they remain busy in dua etc.

It is also related from him that 
Allah has appointed 4000 Angels at the grave of Husain (a.s.) who lament for him with hair spread out from the morning till Zuhr, like a tragedy stricken person laments. As soon as it is Zuhr they fly away and another 4000 descend and continue to weep till the sunrise.
There are a lot of traditions on this subject, showing that weeping at his grave is very meritorious. It is the place of reciting Marsiya and lamentations for the shias. The tradition of Imam Sadiq (a.s.) related by Safwan tells us how angels invoke curses on the killers of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) and Imam Husain (a.s.), how the jinns recite Nauhas, how the angels weep around the Zari of Imam Husain (a.s.) and how they mourn. If someone comes to know of it he would not bear to eat, drink or sleep anymore. And it is mentioned in the tradition of Abdullah bin Hammad Basri that

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) told him:
I have learnt that some groups from around Kufa come for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) and apart from them other men and women also come and recite Nauha on Imam Husain (a.s.) and this happens on 15th Shaban. Some of them recite the Quran, some are busy in relating incidents and some recite the account of martyrdom.

I said: May I be sacrificed on you, I have also seen these things you mentioned. He said:
Thanks be to Allah that He created such persons among the people who come to us and praise us and made our enemies such that they ridicule them and terrify them and regard their deed as evil.
It is there in the beginning of this tradition that one who goes for their Ziyarat and laments on him and one that does not go for his Ziyarat but commemorates his sorrow and his heart is restless and one who remembers Imam Husain (a.s.) and has mercy on his condition and who glances at the grave of his son at his foot. In the desert where there were not any relatives and friends present and their right was usurped. Renegades and disbelievers gathered and in co-operation with each other martyred him and did not bury him. They just left him in the desert. And stopped the water of Furaat for him while even the animals drank this water. And they destroyed the right of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and they did not follow the bequest of the Prophet that he had made regarding his Ahle Bayt (a.s.). Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has narrated from Haaris Aa’war that Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) said:
May my parents be sacrificed on Husain who is martyred behind Kufa. By Allah, as if I see all types of wild animals with raised heads going towards his grave and weep on him the whole day. And when it happens you must beware of oppressing. There are many other traditions on this subject.

20. Sayyed Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) says: It is recommended that when one completes his Ziyarat and decides to come out from the Shrine, he should cling to the Zari, kiss it and say:
 اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا مَوْلايَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا حُجَّةَ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا صِفْوَةَ، اللهِ اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا خالِصَةَ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا قَتيلَ الظَّماءِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا غَريبَ الْغُرَباءِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ سَلامَ مُوَدِّع لا سَئِم وَلا قال، فَاِنْ اَمْضِ فَلا عَنْ مَلالَة، وَاِنْ اُقِمْ فَلا عَنْ سُوءِ ظَن بِما وَعَدَ اللهُ الصّابِرينَ، لا جَعَلَهُ اللهُ آخِرَ الْعَهْدِ مِنّي لِزِيارَتِكَ، وَرَزَقَنِيَ اللهُ الْعَوْدَ اِلى مَشْهَدِكَ وَالْمَقامَ بِفَنائِكَ وَالْقِيامَ فِي حَرَمِكَ وَاِيّاهُ اَسْألُ اَنْ يُسْعِدَني بِكُمْ وَيَجْعَلَني مَعَكُمْ فِي الدُّنْيا وَالاْخِرَةِ""",
        "translation":
            """1.Before leaving the house keep three fasts, on the third day perform the ritual bath (Ghusl) as Imam Sadiq (a.s.) taught
to Safwan, which we would mention in the discussion on the 7th Ziyarat. Shaykh Mohammad bin Mashadi has
mentioned in the prefaces to the Ziyarats of two Eids that when you decide to perform the Ziyarat of Imam (a.s.) you
must keep three fasts and perform the Ghusl on the third day and then gather your family members around you and recite as follows: 

O Allah! I entrust to You today my ownself and my household and
my wealth and my children and everything that is with me, whether
it be present or absent. O Allah! Protect us by Your Protection and
guard us by the safety of faith. O Allah! Include us in Your refuge
and do not snatch away Your bounty from us nor alter any bounty
and security which we possess. Rather, increase Your grace upon us.Surely we covet for You.

Then leave your home with humility and respect and continue to repeat

There is no god except Allah and Allah is most great and all-praise belong to Allah

Continue to praise Allah and send blessings on Mohammad and
his Progeny and walk with demenour and patience. Traditions say
that from each drop of perspiration of the visitor to the grave of
Imam Husain (a.s.), the Almighty Allah creates 70000 angels who
beg forgiveness on behalf of the Imam and his visitor till the day of Qiyamat. 

2.It is related from Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) that when you go
for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) you must go in a
sorrowful way, your hair awry, smeared with dust and in a
hungry and thirsty condition, as Imam (a.s.) was also
martyred in this condition. And ask for your legitimate
needs and come back from there, do not make it your hometown. 

3. Do not carry with you delicacies like biryani, sweets etc. as
provisions of the journey when you travel for the Ziyarat of
Imam Husain (a.s.). You should instead have plain meals like
bread and milk or bread and curd. It is related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that he said:

I have heard that some people go for the Ziyarat of Imam
Husain (a.s.) carrying delicious foods like roasted goats
and sweets, while they go to the graves of their fathers and friends without these things

In another reliable tradition it is mentioned that he (a.s.) told
Mufazzal Ibne umar:

Perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) as it is better than not performing it and do not perform the Ziyarat as it is better than performing it. 

Mufazzal said: Your honour has broken my back. He (a.s.) said:

By Allah, when you visit the graves of your fathers you do it in a sorrowful condition and when you go for the
Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) you carry with yourself different types of food and sweets, while you should go smeared with dust and with your hair disheveled.

The writer says: How nice it would be if in this journey, affluent and business people follow these things and in the journey to Kerbala they do not accept the invitation of any friend and they do not
accept the gifts of roasted chicken and biryani etc. They should clearly say that they are travelers to Kerbala and such delicacies are not suitable for them. Shaykh Kulaini (r.a.) has reported that after
the martyrdom of Imam Husain (a.s.) his wife Kalbiya arranged a Majlis, she herself wept and all the women and servants also wept
till their tears dried up. A gift was sent to this lady from somewhere containing a chicken dish that would enable them to regain
strength for weeping more. The lady asked: What is it? People said that such and such person has sent it so that you may be helped in the mourning of Imam (a.s.). She replied:

We are not in a gathering of wedding celebration. What do we have to do with such delicacies? Then she ordered that it be taken out of the house. 

4. It is recommended that during the journey for Ziyarat of
Imam Husain (a.s.) we must be in all humility and respect
and travel like a lowly slave. Thus those who travel in
modern vehicles should take care that they are not afflicted
with pride and compare themselves to the poor pilgrims
who trek and trudge for the Ziyarat. They should not
consider them lowly. The scholars have mentioned in
details about the people of the cave that they were special
subjects of king Dakyaanoos and they were like his
ministers. But when the mercy of Allah favoured them they
thought of Allah’s worship and their personal reformation.

Thus they decided that their well-being was in secluding themselves from the people and take refuge in the cave to concentrate on the worship of Allah. So they mounted their horses and left the town. When they had traveled a distance of three miles, Tamleekha, one of their associates said

Brothers! This is the path to the Hereafter. It should be traveled like
a beggar and poor person and we must leave the worldly kingdom
and riches. Now dismount the horses and walk towards God on foot.
Maybe your Lord would have mercy upon you and ease your affair for you. 

All of them dismounted and that day those great people covered a
distance of seven farsakhs on foot, till their feet were injured and
bleeding. Thus the visitors to this grave should keep these things
in mind and should know that whoever displays humility in this
journey would be exalted in status by Allah. So whoever goes for
Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.), for each of his step Allah writes a
thousand good deeds and erases a thousand sins and elevates his
status in Paradise by a thousand grades. Thus when you reach the
Furaat Canal, perform ghusl there and become barefooted and
carry your footwear in your hands and walk like a humiliated slave

5. If one sees that pilgrims on foot are tired and need some
help one must give preference to their assistance and help
them reach the destination. Beware! Do not consider them
respectless and do not ignore their requests. Shaykh Kulaini
(a.r.) has narrated a reliable tradition from Abu Haroon that
he said: I was present with Imam Sadiq (a.s.) when he told those around him:
What has happened to you that you consider us lowly?
A person from Khorasan stood up and said: We seek Allah’s refuge that we should consider you lowly. Imam (a.s.) said:
Yes, you are also of those who have considered us unimportant and lowly.

The man said: I seek Allah’s refuge that I should consider you lowly. Imam (a.s.) said:

Woe on you, when you were with me at Johfa you did not pay heed to the person who was begging you to let him
ride for a mile on your mount, “By Allah I am very tired.”By Allah you did not even look towards him and
considered him lowly. One who considers a believer lowly has insulted us and dishonoured the Almighty.

The writer says: We have related a tradition from Ali bin Yaqtin in
the ninth etiquette of Ziyarat. Though it is common for all Ziyarats,
it is specially significant during the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.).
Therefore it is most advisable that readers apply the same etiquette here. 

6.It is narrated from the great Mohammad bin Muslim that he asked Imam Baqir (a.s.): When we go to the Ziyarat of your respected forefather, Husain Ibne Ali (a.s.) are we not like
when we go for Hajj? ‘Yes’, said the Imam (a.s.). Then all those things that are necessary for a Haji pilgrim also apply
here? Imam (a.s.) said:It is necessary that you behave with kindness with your co-travelers and except for kind words speak little.You must remember Allah much. Your dress should be clean
and ritually pure. Perform the ghusl before entering the precincts. Send salawat on Mohammad and Aale
Mohammad as much as possible. It is necessary that your avoid those things that do not befit you. Avoid the
harmful things, be kind to those of your believing brothers, who are in problems. If you see that someone
has exhausted the provisions of the journey you must help him and distribute your provision between him and yourself. 

Taqaiyyah is necessary for you, it is the basis ofreligion. It is compulsory to avoid the things prohibited by
Allah. You must avoid fights, arguments and dispute that
necessitate swearing. If you follow all these things you will
get the full reward of Hajj and Umrah. You will become
eligible for the reward from the One for Whom you have
spent your money and separated from your family. You will return after having your sins forgiven and after achieving Allah’s pleasure

7.In the chapter of the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.), Abu
Hamza Somali (r.a.) has narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that
when you reach the land of Nainawa you should remove your shoes. And till the time you stay there you must not apply oil, wear surma and eat meat. 

You must perform ghusl with the water of Furaat as it is
praised too much in traditions. In one tradition Imam Sadiq
(a.s.) is quoted that one who does ghusl in Furaat and
performs the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) would be
purified of his sins as if he were born on that day even if he
had major sins in his account. It is narrated that Imam Sadiq
(a.s.) was asked: Many a times it is seen that when we go for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) it is very difficult for us to bathe due to cold climate etc? Imam (a.s.) said:

One who does ghusl in Furaat and performs the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) has unlimited merits written for him.
Bashir Dahan has narrated that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said:

One who goes for the Ziyarat of the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) and does Wuzu or ghusl in Furaat, for each step that he takes he would get the reward for a Hajj and Umrah.

In one tradition it is said that one should perform the ghusl in Furaat at the spot facing the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.). As told in traditions it is better that when we reach the Furaat we should recite 100 times ALLAHU AKBAR 100 times LA ILAAHA ILLALLAH and recite salawat 100 times.

9.When one decides to enter the precincts one should enter from the East as told by Imam Sadiq (a.s.) to Yusuf bin Kanasi.

10.It is mentioned in the tradition of Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) that
Imam Sadiq (a.s.) told Mufazzal Ibne Umar:O Mufazzal when you reach the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) you should stand at the entrance of the shrine and
recite the following words as in lieu of each word you would get a portion of divine mercy:

Peace be on you, O inheritor of Adam, the chosen one of Allah.Peace be on you, O inheritor of Nuh, the Prophet of Allah. Peace be
on you, O inheritor of Ibrahim, tire friend of Allah. Peace be on you,O inheritor of Musa, who spoke to Allah. Peace be on you, O
inheritor of ‘Isa, the spirit of Allah. Peace be on you, O inheritor of Muhammad, tire beloved of Allah. Peace be on you, O inheritor of‘Ali, the successor to the Prophet of Allah. Peace be on you, O
inheritor of Hasan, the contented one. 

Peace be on you, O inheritor of Fatima, daughter of the Prophet of Allah. Peace be on you, O truthful martyr. Peace be on you, O upright, pious successor. Peace
be on you, and on the souls that perished with you and suffered with you on your journey. Peace be on the angels of Allah surrounding you. I bear witness that you established the prayers,gave the zakat, commanded the good and forbade evil.You worshipped Allah with all sincerity until death overtook you. Peace be on you and may the mercy and blessings be on you


Then go towards the grave and remember that for each step you
take you would be rewarded equal to the person who baths in his
blood on the path of Allah. When you reach the grave place your
hand upon it and say:

Peace be on you, O proof of Allah on His earth and heavens

Then turn your attention towards namaz. Whatever prayers you
pray there you would be rewarded for them equal to the person
who has performed a thousand Hajjs and Umrahs, freed a
thousand slaves and rose up to fight jihad with a messenger a
thousand times

11.Abu Saeed Madaa-eni is reported to have said: I went to
Imam Sadiq (a.s.) and asked: Shall I go for the Ziyarat of the
grave of Imam Husain (a.s.)? Yes, the Imam replied.

Go for the Ziyarat of the son of the Prophet, who was the
best of the righteous people. When you perform his
Ziyarat you must stand at the head of the grave and recite
the Tasbeeh of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) thousand times
and recite 2 rakats Namaz at the feet, and in those 2
rakats after Surah Hamd recite surah Yasin and surah
Rahman. If you do this you would be highly rewarded.

I said: Please teach me the Tasbeeh of Ali (a.s.) and Fatemah (a.s.).

Imam (a.s.) said:O Abu Saeed! The Tasbeeh of Ali is as follows: 

Glory be to He Whose signs never disappear! Glory be to He Whose reserves never grow less. Glory be to He Whose Glory never runs low. Glory be to He Who never suffers loss in what He has. Glory be to He in Whose range and reach there is no gap! Glory be to He Who
shares with no one in the administration of His affairs, Glory be to He, except Whom, there is no go

And the Tasbeeh of Fatemah (s.a.) is as follows: 

Glory be to the Lord of Honor, and Sublime Authority; Glory be to the Lord of Majesty and Exalted Greatness; Glory be to the Lord of eternal Pride. Glory be to He Who is Splendor and Beauty; Glory be to He Who is Light and Dignity; Glory be to He Who makes out the footprints of the ant on the stone; Glory be to He Who knows (the exact time and place) the bird dips down through the air; Glory be to He Who is like this and no one (other than Him) is like this. 

12. Recite your obligatory and Nafelah prayers near the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) because a prayer recited there would be accepted. Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) says: Try to perform 
your obligatory and Nafelah prayers in the sanctuary.Indeed tradition says that reciting obligatory prayers at the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) carries the reward of Hajj and reciting Nafelah prayers is as rewarding as Umrah. 

The writer says: In the tradition of Mufazzal the performance of
Namaz in the holy precincts has been mentioned as very
rewarding. It is related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) in a reliable
tradition that one who perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain
(a.s.) and recites 2 or 4 rakats near his grave, will have the
reward of Hajj and Umrah written for him. And it is
apparent from traditions that the Namaz-e-Ziyarat etc,
should be recited behind the grave and above the head.
However, if one recites it above the head one should stand
a little behind so that one is not exactly opposite the actual
grave. And it is mentioned in the tradition of Abu Hamza
Sumaali (r.a.) that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) is reported to have said,
‘One should recite 2 rakats Namaz above the head. In the
first rakat after surah Hamd recite Surah Yasin and in the
second rakat after Surah Hamd recite Surah Yasin? If one
wants one can also pray behind the grave, but at the
headside it is better. After the prayer recite any other
prayers. 

But this 2 rakat prayer is necessary to be recited at every grave that is visited. Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has narrated from Imam Mohammad Baqir (a.s.) that he told one person:
O so and so! Who stops you from it that whenever you have a need you go to the grave of Husain (a.s.) and recite 4 rakats prayer and then pray for your needs? Doubtlessly,reciting obligatory prayer near him is equal to Hajj and reciting Nafelah prayer is equal to Umrah. 

13. We should know that the best action in the Shrine of Imam
Husain (a.s.) is Dua. Because the acceptance of prayers
below his dome is one of the things bestowed by Allah in
lieu of the martyrdom. The pilgrim should consider it in his
favour and he must not be lazy in invocating, praying and
weeping. Many meaningful duas have been recorded in
connection with the Ziyarat of this Imam. If we had not
intended conciseness here we would have related some of
the duas. It is better to recite as much as possible from the
duas of Sahifa Kamelah. We would mention a dua after
Ziyarat-e-Jaameah at the end the of this chapter that can
be recited in any Shrine. But we also give here a dua which
is mentioned in connection with Ziyarat. The dua is as
follows and one should recite it inside the shrine with
hands raised to the sky:

O my Allah You takes notice of my position, hears whatever I say,
understands my approach, my deep affection, and my "refugetaking" keenness for the "resting abode" of Your Proof, the son of
Your prophet. O my Master, You knows what I want, my condition is
not hidden from You, therefore, I turn to You, through Your
Apostle's son, Your Proof and Your confidant, I seek Your and Your
Apostle's nearness through him, so, on account of him, let me be
respectable and dignified before You, in this world and in the
Hereafter, and also let me be Your close attendant and fulfill my
desires in return of my (this) visitation, make a present of my joys
and delights, bestow upon me that which I passionately crave and
long for, satisfy my wants and needs do not send me away
disappointed, do not cut off my holes, do not reject my prayers, let
acceptance of my supplications in the affairs of my religion and this
world and the hereafter become apparent for me and include me
among those of Your servants who have been kept safe from
dangers, diseases, distress and disadvantages, (whom) You let live
in peace and prosperity, let me die in complete tranquillity, and
enter the Paradise in ecstasy, take refuge in Your sanctuary to avoid
the flames of the Fire. Provide me with a steady welfare, as a favour,
which I ardently desire for myself, my family, my children, my
brothers, my possessions, and for all that which You has bestowed upon me, O the most Merciful of all who show mercy!

14.One of the aamals of the shrine of Imam Husain (a.s.) is to recite durood upon him, tradition says that one should stand behind the Imam near his shoulder and recite durood on the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and on Imam Husain (a.s.).Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (a.r.) has quoted this salawat in Misbaahuz Zaaereen in connection with a Ziyarat:

O Allah! Bless Mohammad and the progeny of Mohammad and bless
Husayn, the oppressed the martyr, the on who was killed while he
was in tears and engulfed in calamities, with an ever growing and
pure and blessed salutation which has a lofty start and a never
ending finale, better than whatever You have sent on anyone from
the children of the Prophets and the Apostles, O the Lord of the
Universe. O Allah, bless the martyred leader, the murdered
oppressed forsaken, chief, guide, worshipper, abstinent, vicegerent,
caliph, commander, truthful, chaste, pure, purified, blessed,
satisfied (with Allah), Allah is satisfied with him, pious, guide,
guided one, abstemious, protector, warrior, scholar, leader of
guidance, grandson of the Apostle, the apple of the eye of the
immaculate (Fatemah) may Allah bless him and his family.

 O Allah! Bless my leader and my master as he has acted in Your obedience and has kept away from Your disobedience and strove to attain
Your satisfaction and stepped forward towards believing in You, he
did not accept any excuse regarding You, in secret or openly. He
called the servants towards You and guided them to You and stood
before You. He demolished tyranny with truth and enlivened the
traditions through the Book then he resided in Your satisfaction
exhausted and passed away in Your satisfaction and in that of Your
friends and he entrusted his life to You. He did not disobey You in
the night nor in the day, rather he fought for You against the
hypocrites and the disbeliever. O Allah! Then grant him the best
reward reserved for the truthful and the righteous ones and
augment the punishment against them (his enemies) and the
chastisement upon his killers. For surely, he fought honourably and
was killed unjustly and died in mercy. He was saying to his killers I
am the son of the Apostle of Allah Mohammad and the son of the
one who offered alms and worshipped Allah, yet they killed him
intentionally. They killed him while he was on faith and they obeyed
the devil by killing him and did not pay any attention to the
Beneficent (Allah) concerning him. O Allah! Then bless my leader
and my master which a salutation through which You raise his
remembrance and manifest his affair and hasten his help and
distinguish him with the best kinds of virtues on the day of
judgement and grant him an honour in the highest grades of
paradise and make him attain the lofty honour of the noble ones
and through the nobility of Your Mercy, elevate him to the honour
of Your proximate ones in the exalted and highest position and
make him reach the "Wasila" (pulpit) and the venerable status and
grace and virtue and abundant esteem. O Allah! Then reward him
from our side, the best reward which You have awarded to a leader
from his subjects and bless my leader and master whenever he is
mentioned and whenever he is not. O my leader and master, include me in your party and your group and seek grant for me from your
Lord and my Lord for surely you possess a lofty standing and an
elevated rank near Allah. 

If you ask, you are granted and if you intercede, Allah accepts your intercession concerning your servant
and your friend. O Allah! Do not forsake the face of calamities and
horrors due to my bad deeds and evil actions and great crimes for
surely you are my hope and my expectation and my trust and my
confidant and my medium towards Allah, my Lord and your Lord.
The implorers do not beseech Allah with a medium more rightful or
revered or esteemed near Him than you, O the people of the house.
May Allah not separate me from you on account of my sins and may
He gather in the garden of Eden which He has prepared for you and
your friends, surely He is the best of the forgivers and the most
merciful of all those who show mercy. O Allah! Convey to my leader
and my master abundant greetings and salutations and return his salutation to us. Surely You are the Generous, the Noble and bless him whenever salutation is mentioned and whenever it is not, O the Lord of the Universe.

The writer says: We have quoted this Ziyarat in the Aamal of the day of Ashura. And at the end of the chapter we would quote one salawat upon Hojaj-e-Taaherah (The Purified Proofs) (a.s.) and a short salawaat would also be quoted for Imam Husain (a.s.) and we must not omit reciting it. 

15. Of the aamals of this Shrine Dua-e-Mazloom (Prayer of the oppressed) is also mentioned. That is, if one is oppressed
one should recite this prayer inside the Shrine. The dua is
such that the Shaykh-e-Taaefah (r.a.) has mentioned it in
“Misbaahul Mutahajjid” in the aamal of Friday and said: It is
recommended that one recites this Dua-e-Mazloom near
the grave of Abi Abdullah Al-Husain (a.s.). The dua is as follows:

O Allah! Surely I have been priviledged on account of Your religion
and honoured by Your guidance and so and so intends to humiliate
me by his evil designs and to degrade me by his tortures and he
finds fault with me due to the mastership of Your representative. He
has amazed me with his claim and surely I have come to You in this
place of supplication when its acceptance is guaranteed by You. O
Allah, bless Mohammad and the progeny of Mohammad and at this very moment make me dominant over him.

Then one should throw oneself on the grave and say:

O my master and my chief, an oppressed beseeches you for assistance against his oppressors. Please help him

16. In the aamals of this Shrine is that dua also which Ibne Fahd quoted in Uddatud Daaee from Imam Sadiq (a.s.). He says: If one is having some need to be asked from Allah (s.w.t.),one should stand near the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) and say: 

O Abu ‘Abd Allah. I bear witness that you see my position, hear my speech and you are alive with your Lord, sustained and nourished by Him. I am asking your and my Lord to fulfill my needs.

17. In aamal only it is mentioned that 2 rakats namaz must be recited in the Shrine near the holy head, in which surah Rahman and Tabarak is recited. Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) has narrated that one who performs this namaz would be rewarded equal to 25 accepted Hajjs performed with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.). 

18.One of the aamal of this blessed grave is also Istekhara. The
method is same as mentioned by Allamah Majlisi (r.a.). The
actual narration is in the book “Qarbul Asnaad’ of Humairi
(r.a.). He says: with correct chains it is narrated from Imam
Sadiq (a.s.) that one who asks Allah for goodness in some
affair a hundred times and standing near the head of Imam
Husain (a.s.) he says: ALHAMDO LILLAHE WA LAA ELAAHA  ILLAL LAAHO,SUBHANALLAHE and remembers Allah with this
greatness and praises and glorifies Him as is His right and
asks for goodness in this affair a hundred times, Allah will
surely show him whatever is good in this affair and bring it
before him. According to another tradition one should pray
for goodness a hundred times in the following manner:

I seek that which is good from Allah through His Mercy, the goodness for the outcome. 

19. Shaykh Abul Qasim Jafar Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that he said:
Whenever you do the Ziyarat of Abu Abdillah al-Husain(a.s.) except for speaking good keep quiet as the guarding angels come night and day to the angels who are presentin the holy precincts and they shake hands with those
angels, but due to intense lamentations they do not reply and they continue to weep and wait. Yet they fall silent at
the time of Zawaal (afternoon) and Sunrise. Thus the guarding angels wait for the afternoon and sunrise, so that they can speak to them during these two times and ask them about the affairs of the heavens. But even in those times the Angels of the precincts do not talk, instead they remain busy in dua etc.It is also related from him that
Allah has appointed 4000 Angels at the grave of Husain
(a.s.) who lament for him with hair spread out from the
morning till Zuhr, like a tragedy stricken person laments.
As soon as it is Zuhr they fly away and another 4000
descend and continue to weep till the sunrise.

There are a lot of traditions on this subject, showing that weeping at his grave is very meritorious. It is the place of reciting Marsiya
and lamentations for the shias. The tradition of Imam Sadiq (a.s.) related by Safwan tells us how angels invoke curses on the killers
of Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) and Imam Husain (a.s.), how the jinns recite Nauhas, how the angels weep around the Zari of Imam Husain (a.s.) and how they mourn. If someone comes to know of it
he would not bear to eat, drink or sleep anymore. And it is mentioned in the tradition of Abdullah bin Hammad Basri that  

Imam Sadiq (a.s.) told him:

I have learnt that some groups from around Kufa come for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) and apart from them other men and women also come and recite Nauha on
Imam Husain (a.s.) and this happens on 15th Shaban. Some of them recite the Quran, some are busy in relating incidents and some recite the account of martyrdom.

I said: May I be sacrificed on you, I have also seen these things you mentioned. He said:Thanks be to Allah that He created such persons among the people who come to us and praise us and made our enemies such that they ridicule them and terrify them and regard their deed as evil.

It is there in the beginning of this tradition that one who goes for their Ziyarat and laments on him and one that does not go for his
Ziyarat but commemorates his sorrow and his heart is restless and one who remembers Imam Husain (a.s.) and has mercy on his
condition and who glances at the grave of his son at his foot. In the desert where there were not any relatives and friends present
and their right was usurped. Renegades and disbelievers gathered and in co-operation with each other martyred him and did not
bury him. They just left him in the desert. And stopped the water of Furaat for him while even the animals drank this water. And they destroyed the right of the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) and they did
not follow the bequest of the Prophet that he had made regarding his Ahle Bayt (a.s.). Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has narrated from Haaris Aa’war that Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) said:
May my parents be sacrificed on Husain who is martyred behind Kufa. By Allah, as if I see all types of wild animals with raised heads going towards his grave and weep on
him the whole day. And when it happens you must beware of oppressing. 

There are many other traditions on this subject.

20. Sayyed Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) says: It is recommended that when one completes his Ziyarat and decides to come out from the Shrine, he should cling to the Zari, kiss it and say: 

Peace be on you, O my master, peace be on you, O proof of Allah.Peace be on you, O one chosen by Allah. Peace be on you, O sincere one for Allah. Peace be on you, O one who was killed thirsty. Peace be on you, O one who was lonesome. 

Peace be on you, I send my farewell greetings to you for if I leave it is not because I am tired or that I wish to leave. If I go away it is not due to boredom or because I do not trust what Allah has promised the patient ones. May Allah not make this my last visit to you. May Allah grant me the opportunity to return to your place and the place where you perished; may Allah give me the opportunity to stand at your sacred place. I ask Him to help me through you and to gather me with you in this and the next world.""",

Shaykh Kulaini (a.r.) has narrated in Kaafi from his chains of narrators from Husain bin Sowair (r.a.) that he said: If I, Yunus bin Zabyaan, Mufazzal ibne Umar and Abu Salma Sarraaj were sitting with Imam Sadiq bin Mohammad (a.s.). Our representative was Yunus as he was senior-most in age among us. He asked Imam (a.s.): May I be sacrificed for you, I go to the assembly of the community, that is the progeny of Abbas, what should I say there? Imam (a.s.) replied:
When you go there remember us and say:

اَللّـهُمَّ اَرِنَا الرَّخاءَ وَالسُّرُورَ

Then whatever reward you want in the hereafter, you will get it. The narrator says that I asked: May I be sacrificed on you, I often remember Imam Husain (a.s.), what should I say at that time? He (a.s.) replied:
Say thrice:
صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ

May Allah bestow His mercy on you, O Abu Abdillah!

Because salutation reaches him whether sent to him from near or at a distance.Then Imam (a.s.) said:

At the time of the martyrdom of Imam Husain (a.s.), the dwellers of the seven heavens and seven earths, the inmates of Paradise and Hell and all the visible and invisible creatures of Allah wept, but three things did not weep upon him.
I asked: May I be sacrificed on you what are those three things? He (a.s.) replied: 

Basra, Damascus and the progeny of Usmaan did not weep on him.

I asked: May I be sacrificed on you what should I say when I go for his Ziyarat? And what I should do? He (a.s.) replied:
When you go for his Ziyarat you should perform Ghusl on the banks of Furaat and wear your ritually pure dress, then proceed barefoot, indeed you are in one of the sanctuaries of Allah and the Prophet and as much as possible while walking you should recite: الله اكبر and لا اله الا الله Praise Allah’s greatness in every utterance. Send blessings on Mohammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Ahle Bayt (a.s.) till you reach the gate of the shrine. Then recite:

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا حُجَّةَ اللهِ وَابْنَ حُجَّتِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يا مَلائِكَةَ اللهِ وَزُوّارَ قَبْرِ ابْنِ نَبِيِّ اللهِ

Then move ten steps forward and then stop and say الله اكبر thrice, then move towards the grave and stand before the Imam while the Qibla should be between your two shoulders, that is your back is towards Qibla. Recite the following:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا حُجَّةَ اللهِ وَابْنَ حُجَّتِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا قَتيلَ اللهِ وَابْنَ قَتيلِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا ثارَ اللهِ وَابْنَ ثارِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وِتْرَ اللهِ الْمَوْتُورَ فِي السَّماواتِ وَالاَْرْضِ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ دَمَكَ سَكَنَ فِي الْخُلْدِ وَاقْشَعَرَّتْ لَهُ اَظِلَّةُ الْعَرْشِ، وَبَكى لَهُ جَميعُ الْخَلائِقِ وَبَكَتْ لَهُ السَّماواتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاَْرَضُونَ السَّبْعُ وَما فيهِنَّ وَما بَيْنَهُنَّ وَمَنْ يَتَقَلَّبُ فِي الْجَنَّةِ وَالنّارِ مِنْ خَلْقِ رَبِّنا وَما يُرى وَما لا يُرى، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ حُجَّةُ اللهِ وَابْنُ حُجَّتِهِ، وَاَشْهَدُ أنَّكَ قَتيلُ اللهِ وابنُ قَتيلِهِ واَشْهَدُ أنَّكَ ثارُ اللهِ وابْنَ ثارِهِ، وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّك وِتْرُ اللهِ الْمَوْتورُ فِي السَّماواتِ وَالاَْرْضِ، وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ بَلَّغْتَ وَنَصَحْتَ وَوَفَيْتَ وَاَوْفَيْتَ وَجاهَدْتَ فِي سَبيلِ اللهِ وَمَضَيْتُ لِلَّذي كُنْتَ عَلَيْهِ شهَيداً وَمُسْتَشْهِداً وَشاهِداً وَمَشْهُوداً، اَنَا عَبْدُاللهِ وَمَوْلاكَ وَفِي طاعَتِكَ وَالْوافِدُ اِلَيْكَ اَلَْتمِسُ كَمالَ الْمَنْزِلَةِ عِنْدَ اللهِ وَثَباتَ الْقَدَمِ فِي الْهِجْرَةِ اِلَيْكَ، وَالسَّبيلَ الَّذي لا يَخْتَلِجُ دوُنَكَ مِنَ الدُّخُولِ فِي كِفالَتِكَ الَّتي اَمَرْتَ بِها، مَنْ اَرادَ اللهَ بَدَأَ بِكُمْ، بِكُمْ يُبَيِّنُ اللهُ الْكَذِبَ، وَبِكُمْ يُباعِدُ اللهُ الزَّمانَ الْكَلِبَ، وَبِكُمْ فَتَحَ اللهُ وَبِكُمْ يَخْتِمُ اللهُ، وَبِكُمْ يَمْحُو ما يَشاءُ وَيُثْبِتُ، وبِكُمْ يَفُكُّ الذُّلَّ مِنْ رِقابِنا، وَبِكُمْ يُدْرِكُ اللهُ وِتْرَةَ كُلِّ مُؤْمِن يَطْلَبُ بِها، وَبِكُمْ تَنْبِتُ الاَْرْضُ اَشْجارَها، وَبِكُمْ تُخْرِجُ الاَْرْضُ ثِمارَها، وَبِكُمْ تُنْزِلُ السَّماءُ قَطْرَها وَرِزْقَها، وَبِكُمْ يَكْشِفُ اللهُ الْكَرْبَ، وَبِكُمْ يُنَزِّلُ اللهُ الْغَيْثَ، وَبِكُمْ تُسَبِّحُ الاَْرْضُ الَّتي تَحْمِلْ اَبْدانَكُمْ وَتَسْتَقِرُّ جِبالُها عَنْ مَراسيها اِرادَةُ الرَّبِّ في مَقاديرِ اُمُورِهِ تَهْبِطُ اِلَيْكُمْ وَتَصْدُرُ مِنْ بُيُوتِكُمْ وَالصّادِرُ عَمّا فُصِّلَ مِنْ اَحْكامِ الْعِبادِ، لُعِنَتْ اُمَّةٌ قَتَلَتْكُمْ، وَاُمَّةٌ خالَفَتْكُمْ، وَاُمَّةٌ جَحَدَتْ وَلايَتَكُمْ، وَاُمَّةٌ ظاهَرَتْ عَلَيْكُمْ، وَاُمَّةٌ شَهِدَتْ وَلَمْ تُسْتَشْهَدْ، اَلْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذي جَعَلَ النّارَ مَأواهُمْ وَبِئْسَ وِرْدُ الْوارِدينَ، وَبِئْسَ الْوِرْدُ الْمَوْرُودُ، وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ رَبِّ الْعالَمينَ

Repeat thrice:
وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ

Repeat thrice:
اَنَا اِلَى اللهِ مِمَّنْ خالَفَكَ بَريءٌ

After this rise up and go near the grave of his son, Hazrat Ali Akbar bin al-Husain (a.s.), who is buried besides his father. And recite:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا ابْنَ رَسُولِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا ابْنَ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا ابْنَ الْحَسَنِ وَالْحُسَيْنِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا ابْنَ خَديجَةَ وَفاطِمَةَ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْكَ، لَعَنَ اللهُ مَنْ قَتَلَكَ

Say thrice
انا اِلَى اللهِ مِنْهُمْ بَريءٌ

Rise up after this and point towards all the martyrs and say:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ، فُزْتُمْ وَاللهِ فُزْتُمْ وَاللهِ فُزْتُمْ وَاللهِ، فَلَيْتَ اَنّي مَعَكُمْ فَاَفُوزَ فَوْزاً عَظيماً

Then come back and stand before the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.), that is stand behind the grave and recite six rakats namaz. Now his Ziyarat is complete. If one wants one can go back.

            """Shaykh Kulaini (a.r.) has narrated in Kaafi from his chains of
narrators from Husain bin Sowair (r.a.) that he said: If I, Yunus bin
Zabyaan, Mufazzal ibne Umar and Abu Salma Sarraaj were sitting
with Imam Sadiq bin Mohammad (a.s.). Our representative was
Yunus as he was senior-most in age among us. He asked Imam
(a.s.): May I be sacrificed for you, I go to the assembly of the
community, that is the progeny of Abbas, what should I say there?
Imam (a.s.) replied:

When you go there remember us and say: 

Then whatever reward you want in the hereafter, you will get it.The narrator says that I asked: May I be sacrificed on you, I often remember Imam Husain (a.s.), what should I say at that time? He (a.s.) replied:

Say thrice: 
May Allah bestow His mercy on you, O Abu Abdillah! 

Because salutation reaches him whether sent to him from near or
at a distance.

Then Imam (a.s.) said:

At the time of the martyrdom of Imam Husain (a.s.), the
dwellers of the seven heavens and seven earths, the
inmates of Paradise and Hell and all the visible and
invisible creatures of Allah wept, but three things did not
weep upon him.

I asked: May I be sacrificed on you what are those three things? He (a.s.) replied:

Basra, Damascus and the progeny of Usmaan did not weep on him.
I asked: May I be sacrificed on you what should I say when I go for
his Ziyarat? And what I should do? He (a.s.) replied:
When you go for his Ziyarat you should perform Ghusl on
the banks of Furaat and wear your ritually pure dress,
then proceed barefoot, indeed you are in one of the sanctuaries of Allah and the Prophet and as much as possible while walking you should recite:ALLAHU AKBAR AND LA ILAAHA ILLALLAH.Praise Allah’s greatness in every utterance. Send
blessings on Mohammad (s.a.w.a.) and his Ahle Bayt (a.s.) till you reach the gate of the shrine. Then recite:

Peace be on you, O the Proof of Allah and the son of His Proof Peace be on you, O the angels of Allah the visitors of the grave of the Prophet's son

Then move ten steps forward and then stop and say ALLAHU AKBAR thrice,then move towards the grave and stand before the Imam while the Qibla should be between your two shoulders, that is your back is towards Qibla. Recite the following: 

Peace be on you, O the proof of Allah and the son of His proof. Peace be on you, O the one killed in the way of Allah as was his father.
Peace be on you, O the one whose blood was injustly shed in the way of Allah as was his father. Peace be on you, O the unique
representative of Allah in the heavens and the earth. I bear witness that your blood has found a place in the heaven of eternity and it
has swelled the shadows of the Throne and all the creations have wept upon it and the seven heavens and the seven earth and what is in them and what is between them and whatsoever resides in the
paradise and Hell from the creation of our Lord and from what is seen and what is not seen have all wept over it. 

I bear witness that you are a Proof of Allah and the son of His Proof and I bear witness that you were killed in the way of Allah just as your father and I bear
witness that your blood was unjustly shed in the way of Allah just as your father's and I bear witness that you are a unique representative
of Allah in the heavens and the earth and I bear witness that you have conveyed (the message) and advised and observed (the promise) and fulfilled it and you departed from this world, on the
same belief on which you professed, a martyr and observant and a witness and a witnessed one. I am the servant of Allah and your friend and under your obedience and a delegate unto you. 

I seek perfect status near Allah and the steadfastness of the feet in immigration towards you and treading the path in which none has a say in the entering into your tutelage which you have been ordered.
Whosoever seeks Allah, begins from you, through you does Allah manifest falsehood and on your account, He wards off perilous
times and through you does Allah initiate and by you, does He terminate and through you, He erases whatever He desires and establishes and through you, He has delivered us from degradation
and through you Allah will avenge the blood of every believer which is sought and through you, the earth bears trees and because of
you, the earth brings out its fruits and because of you the sky sends down rain and sustenance and through you, Allah removes the
misfortunes and through you, Allah sends down water and through you, the earth which bears your bodies glorifies Allah and the mountains remain firm on their place. 

The intention of the Lord is in the fate of His affairs which come down towards you and are emanated from your houses and the judgements for the servants
originate from them. May the people be cursed who killed you and the people who opposed you and the people who denied your
mastership and the people who rose up against you and the people who were present but were not witnessed All praise be to Allah Who
has made Hell fire their abode and it is indeed an evil destination and evil are those who enter it and all praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Universe

Repeat thrice:

And may Allah bless you, O Aba Abdillah.

Repeat thrice:

I disassociate myself from those who oppose you

After this rise up and go near the grave of his son, Hazrat Ali Akbar bin al-Husain (a.s.), who is buried besides his father. And recite:

Say thrice:

I disassociate from them in front of Allah
Rise up after this and point towards all the martyrs and say: 

Peace be on you, Peace be on you, By Allah you have succeeded, By Allah, you have succeeded, by Allah, you have succeeded, By Allah I wish I was with you then I also would have achieved a great success

Then come back and stand before the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.),that is stand behind the grave and recite six rakats namaz. Now his Ziyarat is complete. If one wants one can go back.The writer says: This Ziyarat is also mentioned by the Shaykh (a.r.)
in Tahzeeb and Shaykh Sadooq (a.r.) in Man laa Yahzorohul Faqih.The Shaykh (a.r.) says that I have recorded many Ziyarats in the

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الْعَبْدُ الصّالِحُ الْمُطيعُ للهِ وَلِرَسُولِهِ وَلاَِميرِالْمُؤْمِنينَ وَالْحَسَنِ والْحُسَيْنِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِمْ وَسَلَّمَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ وَمَغْفِرَتُهُ وَرِضْوانُهُ وَعَلى رُوحِكَ وَبَدَنِكَ، اَشْهَدُ و اُشْهِدُ اللهَ اَنَّكَ مَضَيْتَ عَلى ما مَضى بِهِ الْبَدْرِيُّونَ وَالُْمجاهِدُونَ فِي سَبيلِ اللهِ الْمُناصِحُونَ لَهُ فِي جِهادِ اَعْدائِهِ الْمُبالِغُونَ فِي نُصْرَةِ اَوْلِيائِهِ الذّابُّونَ عَنْ اَحِبّائِهِ فَجَزاكَ اللهُ اَفْضَلَ الْجَزاءِ، وَاَكْثَرَ الْجَزاءِ، وَاَوْفَرَ الْجَزاءِ، وَاَوْفى جَزاءِ اَحَد مِمَّنْ وَفى بِبَيْعَتِهِ وَاسْتَجابَ لَهُ دَعْوَتَهُ وَاَطاعَ وُلاةَ، اَمْرِهِ اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ بالَغْتَ فِي النَّصيحَةِ، وَاَعْطَيْتَ غايَةَ اْلَْمجْهُودِ، فَبَعَثَكَ اللهُ فِي الشُّهَداءِ، وَجَعَلَ رُوحَكَ مَعَ اَرْواحِ السُّعَداءِ، وَاَعْطاكَ مِنْ جِنانِهِ اَفْسَحَها مَنْزِلاً وَاَفْضَلَها غُرَفاً، وَرَفَعَ ذِكْرَكَ فِي عِلِّيّينَ، وَحَشَرَكَ مَعَ النَّبِيّينَ وَالصِّدّيقينَ وَالشُّهَداءِ وَالصّالِحينَ وَحَسُنَ اُولئِكَ رَفيقاً، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ لَمْ تَهِنْ وَلَمْ تَنْكُلْ، وَاَنَّكَ مَضَيْتَ عَلى بَصيرَة مِنْ اَمْرِكَ مُقْتَدِياً بِالصّالِحينَ، وَمُتَّبِعاً لِلنَّبِيّينَ، فَجَمَعَ اللهُ بَيْنَنا وَبَيْنَكَ وَبَيْنَ رَسُولِهِ وَاَوْلِيائِهِ فِي مَنازِلِ الُْمخْبِتينَ، فَاِنَّهُ اَرْحَمُ الرّاحِمينَ

The writer says: It is better if this Ziyarat is recited at the back of the grave in the direction of qibla as mentioned by Shaykh (r.a.) inTahzeeb.
We should know that according to traditions the Ziyarat of Hazrat Abbas (a.s) is the same that we have already mentioned. But Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (a.r.), Shaykh Mufeed (a.r.) have said after this: Then go to the head side and recite 2 rakats namaz and after that recite whichever namaz you want and supplicate Allah. After the namaz recite the following dua:

اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد، وَلا تَدَعْ لي فِي هذَا الْمَكانِ الْمُكَرَّمِ وَالْمَشْهَدِ الْمُعَظَّمِ ذَنْباً اِلاّ غَفَرْتَهُ، وَلا هَمّاً اِلاّ فَرَّجَتَهُ، وَلا مَرَضاً اِلاّ شَفَيْتَهُ، وَلا عَيْباً اِلاّ سَتَرْتَهُ، وَلا رِزْقاً اِلاّ بَسَطْتَهُ، وَلا خَوْفاً الاّ آمَنْتَهُ، وَلا شَمْلاً اِلاّ جَمَعْتَهُ، وَلا غائِباً اِلاّ حَفَظْتَهُ وَاَدْنَيْتَهُ، وَلا حاجَةً مِنْ حَوائِجِ الدُّنْيا وَالاْخِرَةِ لَكَ فيها رِضىً وَلِيَ فيها صَلاحٌ اِلاّ قَضَيْتَها يا اَرْحَمَ الرّاحِمينَ

Then turn towards the Zari and standing at the footside recite:

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبَا الْفَضْلِ الْعَبّاسَ ابْنَ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ سَيِّدِ الْوَصِيّينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ اَوَّلِ الْقَوْمِ اِسْلاماً وَاَقْدَمِهِمْ ايماناً وَاَقْوَمِهِمْ بِدينِ اللهِ، وَاَحْوَطِهِمْ عَلَى الاِْسْلامِ، اَشْهَدُ لَقَدْ نَصَحْتَ للهِ وَلِرَسُولِهِ وَلاَِخيكَ فَنِعْمَ الاَْخُ الْمُواسي، فَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً قَتَلَتْكَ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً ظَلَمَتْكَ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً اسْتَحَلَّتْ مِنْكَ الَْمحارِمَ، وَانْتَهَكَتْ حُرْمَةَ الاِْسْلامِ، فَنِعْمَ الصّابِرُ الُْمجاهِدُ الُْمحامِي النّاصِرُ وَالاَْخُ الدّافِعُ عَنْ اَخيهِ، الُْمجيبُ اِلى طاعَةِ رَبِّهِ، الرّاغِبُ فيـما زَهِدَ فيهِ غَيْرُهُ مِنَ الثَّوابِ الْجَزيلِ وَالثَّناءِ الْجَميلِ، وَاَلْحَقَكَ اللهُ بِدَرَجَةِ آبائِكَ فِي جَنّاتِ النَّعيمِ، اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي تَعَرَّضْتُ لِزِيارَةِ اَوْلِيائِكَ رَغْبَةً فِي ثَوابِكَ وَرَجاءً لِمَغْفِرَتِكَ وَجَزيلِ اِحْسانِكَ، فَاَسْاَلُكَ اَنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِهِ الطّاهِرينَ، وَاَنْ تَجْعَلَ رِزْقي بِهِمْ دارّاً وَعَيْشي بِهِمْ قارّاً، وَزِيارَتي بِهِمْ مَقْبُولَةً وَحَياتي بِهِمْ طَيِّبَةً، وَاَدْرِجْني اِدْراجَ الْمُكْرَمينَ، وَاجْعَلْني مِمَّنْ يَنْقَلِبُ مِنْ زِيارَةِ مَشاهِدِ اَحِبّائِكَ مُفْلِحاً مُنْجِحاً، قَدِ اسْتَوْجَبَ غُفْرانَ الذُّنُوبِ وَسَتْرَ الْعُيُوبِ وَكَشْفَ الْكُرُوبِ، اِنَّكَ اَهْلُ التَّقْوى وَاَهْلُ الْمَغْفِرَةِ 

And when you wish to bid farewell you should go near the grave and recite this, which is in the tradition of Abu Hamza Sumali (r.a.) and other scholars have also mentioned it:

اَسْتَوْدِعُكَ اللهَ وَاَسْتَرْعيكَ وَاَقْرَأُ عَلَيْكَ اَلسَّلامَ، آمَنّا بِاللهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ وَبِكِتابِهِ وَبِما جاءَ بِهِ مِنْ عِنْدِ اللهِ، اَللّـهُمَّ فَاكْتُبْنا مَعَ الشّاهِدينَ، اَللّـهُمَّ لا تَجْعَلْهُ آخِرَ الْعَهْدِ مِنْ زِيارَتي قَبْرَ ابْنِ اَخي رَسُولِكَ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ، وَارْزُقْني زِيارَتَهُ اَبَداً ما اَبْقَيْتَني وَاحْشُرْني مَعَهُ وَمَعَ آبائِهِ فِي الجِنانِ، وَعَرِّفْ بَيْني وَبَيْنَهُ وَبَيْنَ رَسُولِكَ وَاَوْلِيائِكَ، اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد وَتَوَفَّني عَلَى الاْيمانِ بِكَ وَالتَّصْديقِ بِرَسُولِكَ وَالْوِلايَةِ لِعَليِّ بْنِ اَبي طالِب وَالاَْئِمَّةِ مِنْ وُلْدِهِ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّلامُ وَالْبَراءَةِ مِنْ عَدُوِّهِمْ، فَاِنّي قَدْ رَضيتُ يا رَبِّي بِذلِكَ، وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد

After this pray for yourself, your parents, believers and Muslims and ask for whatever you desire. The writer says: A tradition is related from Hazrat Imam Zainul Aabedeen (a.s.) which in brief is that he (a.s.) said:
May Allah have mercy on Abbas that he gave sacrifice for his brother and gave away his life for him but continued to help Imam Husain (a.s.). The enemies severed both hishands in lieu of which Allah bestowed him two wings. With these wings he flies in Paradise with the Angels like Jafar at-Tayyaar. Abbas is having such a status before Allah that on the day of Qiyamat martyrs would envy it and they would vie for his position.""",
        "translation":
            """The respected scholar Jafar bin Qulwayh (r.a.) has related through
reliable chains from Abu Hamza Sumali (r.a.) that Hazrat Imam Jafar Sadiq (a.s.) said:

When you decide to perform the Ziyarat of the grave of Abbas bin Ali, which is on the banks of Furaat and
opposite the holy precincts, stand at the gate of the tomb and recite: 

May the greetings of Allah, His close angels and the Prophets sent by Allah be on you. May the greetings of His pious servants, all martyrs and truthful ones, who are virtuous and pure, who frequent
you, be on you. O son of the Commander of the Faithful. I bear witness that you submitted yourself to the will of Allah; you were
faithful, giving sound advice to the descendant of the Prophet(s.a.w.a.) and to his chosen grandson. He (Husayn) is the universal
guide, the successor who proclaimed. He was oppressed. On behalf of His Messenger, the Commander of the Faithful, al-Hasan and alHusayn (a.s.) may Allah grant you the best reward due to your patience, support and help. How excellent is the reward in the eternal life. May Allah curse those who killed you, ignored your
rights and gave no importance to your sanctity. May the curse of Allah be on those who stood between you and the river Furat. I bear witness that you were oppressed when killed and that Allah will reward you with what He has promised. 

I have come to you, O son of the Commander of the Faithful, to present myself before you. My heart has submitted to you and follows you. I am your disciple. I am ready to serve you until Allah judges, for He is the best judge. I am
with you, with you, not with your enemies. I believe in you and in your return with other believers. I believe in the return of those infidels who opposed and killed you. May Allah destroy those who killed you by their hands and tongues. 

Then enter the shrine and clinging to the Zari say:

Peace be on you, O pious, obedient servant of Allah and on His
messenger, and on the Commander of the Faithful, on al-Hasan and
al-Husayn (a.s.). May the blessings and greetings of Allah be on
them. Peace be on you and may the mercy and blessings,
forgiveness and pleasure of Allah be on you and on your body and
soul. I bear witness and invoke Allah to be a witness that verily you
trod the path of the warriors of Badr and those striving in the cause
of Allah. You served Him faithfully in the battlefield against His
enemies. You were like those who exerted themselves to support
His friends and defend His beloved favourites. May Allah grant you
the best, vast, continuous, exemplary and conclusive reward that He
gives to those who are loyal to their allegiances, who answer His call
and obey those who exercise authority on His behalf. I bear witness
that you exerted yourself in giving sound advice, and made utmost
efforts to pursue its purpose. May Allah raise you with the martyrs
and let your soul be with the prosperous ones. He has awarded you
a special place and chamber in His Paradise. He has made mention of your name in the illiyin, the highest circle in heaven. He gathered you with the Prophets, the truthful ones, the martyrs and the pious,they are the best companions. I bear witness that you were not
feeble nor did you turn away. You had insight into your matters following in the footsteps of the pious and the Prophets, so may Allah assemble us with His Prophets and His friends in the station of those who are humble, for verily He is the most merciful one.  

The writer says: It is better if this Ziyarat is recited at the back of the

Then go to the head side and recite 2 rakats namaz and after that recite whichever namaz you want and supplicate Allah. After the namaz recite the following dua: 


O Allah, send Your blessings on Muhammad and his family. At this honorable and elevated sanctuary, do not leave any sin of mine unforgiven, nor any difficulties without removing them. Cure every sickness, hide all defects. Spread Your sustenance, do not leave any fear except that You have removed it, nor any group except that You have united it. Do not leave any hidden thing unprotected, fulfill my desires in this and the next world that You are happy with and which are in my interest, O most merciful one.

Then turn towards the Zari and standing at the footside recite: 

Peace be on you, O Abul Fazl al-’Abbas, son of the Commander of
the Faithful. Peace be on you, O son of the leaders of the successor.
Peace be on you, O son of the first in the community to submit and
the foremost in faith. He was the strongest in the religion of Allah
and the best guard of Islam. I bear witness that you admonished the
people for the sake of Allah, His Messenger and your brother. How
nice is the brother who is sympathetic. May Allah curse those who
killed you. May Allah curse those who oppressed you. May Allah
curse those who treated the unlawful as lawful and violated the
sanctity of Islam. How great is the brother who is forbearing, wages
war against the unbelievers, protects and helps. He is one who
defends his brother, obedient to the commandment of his Lord,
desiring to refrain from what others keep away so as to attain
abundant reward and great praises. 

May Allah honor you with the status of your fore fathers in the blessed abode. O Allah, I have desired to visit Your friends, seeking Your rewards and hoping for
forgiveness and abundant goodness from You. I ask You to send blessings on Muhammad and his pure household. Due to them, fix
my sustenance and make my life stable. Due to them, accept my ziyarat and make my life pure. Make me amongst the noble ones
and amongst those who return from visiting the holy sites of Your friends, successful and saved. Make me amongst those who deserve
their sins to be forgiven, defects concealed and difficulties removed. Verily, from You comes piety and forgiveness. 

And when you wish to bid farewell you should go near the grave and recite this, which is in the tradition of Abu Hamza Sumali (r.a.) and other scholars have also mentioned it: 

I bid farewell to you and I sent my greetings to you, believing in Allah, His Prophet, the book and in what has come from Allah. O Allah, record us amongst those who have witnessed, do not make this my last visitation to the grave of the son of the brother of Your Prophet, peace be on him and his family. Grant me a chance to visit him for as long as I am alive. Gather me with him and his ancestors in the gardens. Bring me closer to him and Your Prophet and friends. O Allah, send Your blessings on Muhammad and his family,make me die believing in You and Your Prophet, following Ali b. Abi Talib and the Imams amongst his children (a.s.), dissociating from their enemies for I am happy with that. O my Lord, send Your greetings on Muhammad and his family

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ رَسُولِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا بْنَ خاتَمِ النَّبِيّينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا بْنَ سَيِّدِ الْمُرْسَلينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا بْنَ سَيِّدِ الْوَصِيّينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا حُسَيْنَ بْنَ عَلِيِّ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ فاطِمَةَ سَيِّدَةِ نِساءِ الْعالَمينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وَلِيَّ اللهِ وَابْنَ وَلِيِّهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا صَفِيَّ اللهِ وَابْنَ صَفِيِّهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا حُجَّةَ اللهِ وَابْنَ حُجَّتِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا حَبيبَ اللهِ وابْنَ حَبيبِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا سَفيرَ اللهِ وَابْنَ سَفيرِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا خازِنَ الْكِتابَ الْمَسْطُورِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا وارِثَ التَّوْراةِ وَالاِْنْجيلِ وَالزَّبُورِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا اَمينَ الرَّحْمنِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا شَريكَ الْقُرْآنِ، السَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا عَمُودَ الدِّينِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بابَ حِكْمَةِ رَبِّ الْعالَمينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بابَ حِطَّة الَّذي مَنْ دَخَلَهُ كانَ مِنَ الاْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا عَيْبَةَ عِلْمِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا مَوْضِعَ سِرِّ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا ثارَ اللهِ وَابْنَ ثارِهِ وَالْوِتْرَ الْمَوْتُورَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلى الاَْرْواحِ الّتي حَلَّتْ بِفِنائِكَ وَاَناخَتْ بِرَحْلِكَ، بِاَبي اَنْتَ وَاُمّي وَنَفْسي يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ لَقَدْ عَظُمَتِ الْمُصيبَةُ وَجَلَّتِ الرَّزِيَّةُ بِكَ عَلَيْنا وَعَلى جَميعِ اَهْلِ الاِْسْلامِ، فَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً اَسَّسَتْ اَساسَ الظُّلْمِ وَالْجَوْرِ عَلَيْكُمْ اَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً دَفَعَتْكُمْ عَنْ مَقامِكُمْ وَاَزالَتْكُمْ عَنْ مَراتِبِكُمْ الَّتي رَتَّبَكُمُ اللهُ فيها، بِاَبي اَنْتَ وَاُمّي وَنَفْسي يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ اَشْهَدُ لَقَدِ اقْشَعَرَّتْ لِدِمائِكُمْ اَظِلَّةَ الْعَرْشِ مَعَ اَظِلَّةُ الْخَلائِقِ، وَبَكَتْكُمُ السَّماءُ وَالاَْرْضُ وَسُكّانُ الْجِنانِ وَالْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ، صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ عَدَدَ ما فِي عِلْمِ اللهِ، لَبَّيْكَ داعِيَ اللهِ اِنْ كانَ لَمْ يُجِبْكَ بَدَني عِنْدَ اسْتِغاثَتِكَ وَلِساني عِنْدَ اسْتِنْصارِكَ، فَقَدْ اَجابَكَ قَلْبي وَسَمْعي وَبَصَرَي، سُبْحانَ رَبِّنا اِنْ كانَ وَعْدُ رَبِّنا لَمَفْعُولاً، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ طُهْرٌ طاهِرٌ مُطَهَّرٌ مِنْ طُهْر طاهِر مُطَهَّر، طَهُرْتَ وَطَهُرَتْ بِكَ الْبِلادُ وَطَهُرَتْ اَرْضٌ اَنْتَ بِها وَطَهُرَ حَرَمُكَ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ اَمَرْتَ بِالْقِسْطِ وَالْعَدْلِ وَدَعَوْتَ اِلَيْهِما، وَاَنَّكَ صادِقٌ صِدّيقٌ صَدَقْتَ فيـما دَعَوْتَ اِلَيْهِ، وَاَنَّكَ ثارُ اللهِ فِي الاَْرْضِ، وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ بَلَّغْتَ عَنِ اللهِ وَعَنْ جَدِّكَ رَسُولِ اللهِ وَعَنْ اَبيكَ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ وَعَنْ اَخيكَ الْحَسَنِ، وَنَصَحْتَ وَجاهَدْتَ فِي سَبيلِ اللهِ وَعَبَدْتَهُ مُخْلِصاً حَتّى اَتيكَ الْيَقينُ، فَجَزاكَ اللهُ خَيْرَ جَزاءِ السّابِقينَ، وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْكَ وَسَلَّمَ تَسْليماً، اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد، وَصَلِّ عَلَى الْحُسَيْنِ الْمَظْلُومِ الشَّهيدِ الرَّشيدِ قَتيلِ الْعَبَراتِ وَاَسيرِ الْكُرُباتِ، صَلاةً نامِيَةً زاكِيَةً مُبارَكَةً يَصْعَدُ اَوَّلُها وَلا يَنْفَدُ آخِرُها، اَفْضَلَ ما صَلَّيْتَ عَلى اَحَد مِنْ اَوْلادِ اَنْبِيائِكَ الْمُرْسَلينَ يا اِلـهَ الْعالَمينَ

Now kiss the holy grave and place your right cheek on the grave, then place your left cheek upon it, circle the grave and kiss all around it. Shaykh Mufeed (a.r.) says: After this go to the grave of Ali bin Husain (a.s.) and standing at his grave recite:

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الصِّدّيقُ الطَّيِّبُ الزَّكِيُّ الْحَبيبُ الْمُقَرَّبُ وَابْنَ رَيْحانَةِ رَسُولِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ شَهيد مُحْتَسِب وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ، ما اَكْرَمَ مَقامَكَ وَاَشْرَفَ مُنْقَلَبَكَ، اَشْهَدُ لَقَدْ شَكَرَ اللهُ سَعْيَكَ وَاَجْزَلَ ثَوابَكَ، وَاَلْحَقَكَ بِالذِّرْوَةِ الْعالِيَةِ، حَيْثُ الشَّرَفُ كُلُّ الشَّرفِ وَفِي الْغُرَفِ السّامِيَةِ كَما مَنَّ عَلَيْكَ مِنْ قَبْلُ وَجَعَلَكَ مِنْ اَهْلِ الْبَيْتِ الَّذينَ اَذْهَبَ اللهُ عَنْهُمُ الرِّجْسَ وَطَهَّرَهُمْ تَطْهيراً، صَلَواتُ اللهِ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ وَرِضْوانُهُ، فَاشْفَعْ اَيُّهَا السَّيِّدُ الطّاهِرُ اِلى رَبِّكَ فِي حَطِّ الاَْثْقالِ عَنْ ظَهْري وَتَخْفيفِها عَنّي وَارْحَمْ ذُلّي وَخُضُوعي لَكَ وَلِلسَّيِّدِ اَبيكَ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْكُما

Touch your body to the purified grave and say:
زادَ اللهُ فِي شَرَفِكُمْ فِي الاْخِرَةِ كَما شَرَّفَكُمْ فِي الدُّنْيا، وَاَسْعَدَكُمْ كَما اَسْعَدَ بِكُمْ، وَاَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمْ اَعْلامُ الدّينِ وَنُجُومُ الْعالَمينَ، وَاَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ

After this turn your attention to the other martyrs of Kerbala and say:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يا اَنْصارَ اللهِ وَاَنْصارَ رَسُولِهِ وَاَنْصارَ عَلِيّ بْنِ اَبي طالِب وَاَنْصارَ فاطِمَةَ وَاَنْصارَ الْحَسَنِ وَالْحُسَيْنِ وَاَنْصارَ الاِْسْلامِ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمْ قَدْ نَصَحْتُمْ للهِ وَجاهَدْتُمْ فِي سَبيلِهِ فَجَزاكُمُ اللهُ عَنِ الاِْسْلامِ وَاَهْلِهِ اَفْضَلَ الْجَزاءِ، فُزْتُمْ وَاللهِ فَوْزاً عَظيماً، يا لَيْتَني كُنْتُ مَعَكُمْ فَاَفُوزَ فَوْزاً عَظيماً، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمْ اَحْياءٌ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْزَقُونَ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمُ الشُّهَداءُ وَالسُّعَداءُ وَاَنَّكُمُ الْفائِزوُنَ فِي دَرَجاتِ الْعُلى، واَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ

After this come back and stand at the head of the Imam’s grave and pray namaz-e-Ziyarat and pray for self, the parents and other believers.
We should know that Sayyed Ibne Taaoos (a.r.) has narrated a Ziyarat of Ali Akbar (a.s.) and other martyrs (may they be blessed) which is based on their names. Due to brevity we have restrained from quoting it here.""",
        "translation":
            """Shaykh Mufeed (a.r.) has narrated this Ziyarat in “Mazaar”. It is one of the special Ziyarats of 15th Rajab. It is known as ‘Ghufayla’. That
is 15th Rajab is known as ‘Ghufayla’ and not the Ziyarat and the reason is that ordinary people are ignorant (Ghafil) of its merits.Thus when you decide to perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) at this time and you reach the holy courtyard you should go through the Shrine. Say three time ALLAHU AKBAR and standing at the grave recite as follows

Peace be upon you (all); O the Household of Allah. Peace be upon you (all); O the elite of Allah. Peace be upon you (all); O the best of Allah’s creatures. Peace be upon you (all); O the masters of all masters. Peace be upon you (all); O the lions of jungles. Peace be upon you (all); O the arks of redemption. Peace be upon you; O AbuAbdillah al-Husayn. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you; O the inheritor of the knowledge of the Prophets. Peace be upon you; O the inheritor of Adam, the elite of Allah. Peace be upon you; O the inheritor of Noah, the Prophet of Allah. Peace be upon you; O Abraham, the intimate friend of Allah. Peace be upon you; O the inheritor of Ishmael, the slaughtered by Allah’s order. Peace be upon you; O the inheritor of Moses, the spoken by Allah. Peace be
upon you; O the inheritor of Jesus, the spirit from Allah. Peace be
upon you; O the inheritor of Muhammad, the dearly beloved by
Allah. Peace be upon you; O the son of Muhammad, the Chosen
Prophet. Peace be upon you; O the son of Ali, the Pleased. Peace be
upon you; O the son of Fatemah, the Luminous. Peace be upon you;
O the son of Khadijah, the grand lady. Peace be upon you; O the
martyr and the son of the martyr. Peace be upon you; O the slain
and the son of the slain. Peace be upon you; O the saint and the son
of the saint. Peace be upon you; O the argument of Allah and the
son of His argument against His creatures. I bear witness that you
established the prayers, And you gave the zakat, And you enjoined
the right, And you forbade the wrong, And you were deprived of
your parents, And you strove against your enemies. And I bear
witness that you can now hear the speech, And you can answer
back, And you are verily the beloved of Allah and His intimate friend
and selected servant And His elite and the son of His elite. O my
master and the son of my master: I am visiting you, because of my
eagerness to you, So, (please) my master: be my interceder before
Allah, And I also seek the intercession of your grandfather, the
Master of the Prophets, before Allah, And I seek the intercession of
your father, the Master of the Prophets’ Successors, And I seek the
intercession of your mother, the Doyenne of the women of the
worlds. Verily, may Allah curse those who slew you And may Allah
curse those who wronged you And may Allah curse those who
deprived you (of your right) and those who hated you from the past
and the coming generations. May Allah send blessings upon our
master, Muhammad, and upon his Household – the immaculate and pure. 

Kiss the blessed grave and recite the Ziyarat of Hazrat Ali Akbar(a.s.)

Peace be upon you; O my master and the son of my master. May
Allah curse those who slew you. And may Allah curse those who wronged you. Verily, I seek nearness to Allah through my visiting you and showing my love for you (all). And I release myself before Allah from your enemies. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O my master

Then recite the Ziyarat of the martyrs of Kerbala:

Peace be upon the souls that are residing near the tomb of AbuAbdillahil-Husayn. Peace be upon you (all); O the purified from filth.
Peace be upon you (all); O the well-guided ones. Peace be upon you (all); O the pious ones to Allah. Peace be upon you and upon the angels surrounding all your graves. May Allah gather us with you in the center of His mercy, And under His Throne. Verily, He is the most Merciful of all those who show mercy. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you. 

After this go to the Shrine of Hazrat Abbas bin Ameerul Momineen(a.s.) and standing at the entrance recite: 

Peace of Allah and Peace of His favorite angels, His commissioned
prophets, His righteous servants, all the martyrs, and all the
veracious (ones), and also pure, true blessings that come and go, be
upon you; son of Ameer al-Momineen (chief of the faithful ones). I
testify to you of submission (to the will of Allah), honest acceptance
as true, loyalty, and sincerity with regard to the descendant of the
commissioned Prophet – peace of Allah be upon him and his
Household – the chosen grandson (of the Prophet), the well
knowledgeable guide (to the true religion), the conveying
successor, and the wrongfully oppressed one. (Namely, Imam alHusayn ibn Ali). So, Allah may reward you on behalf of His
Messenger, Ameer al-Mumineen, Al-Hasan and al-Husayn peace of
Allah be upon them, With the best reward for your steadfastness,
dedication (to the sake of Allah), and support (for the right party).
Very excellent be the reward of the eternal life. Allah’s curse be on
him who killed you. And Allah’s curse be on him who omitted your
right, And belittled your sanctity. And Allah’s curse be on him who
precluded you from having from the water of the River Euphrates. I
testify that you were killed wrongfully, and that Allah will verily
fulfill His promise that He made with you. Son of Ameer alMomineen: I have come to you to present myself before you. My
heart is submissive to you and is following you. And I am your
follower. I am ready to support you until Allah decides for me. He is
surely the Best of all who decide. I am verily with you, not with your
enemy. I am one of those who believe in you and believe in your
Return. I also one of those who deny your opposites and killers.
Allah may kill the group who killed you with hands and tongues (by giving orders of killing you.)

One who desires to shake hands with 124000 prophets should perform the Ziyarat of Abu Abdillah al-Husain (a.s.) on 15th Shaban. Indeed the angels and souls of prophets (a.s.) seek the permission of Allah to come for his Ziyarat. Fortunate is one who shakes hands with those prophets (a.s.) and they shake hands with him.

Because they were rasied for the east and the west, for men and jinns all.The words of the Ziyarat are related in two ways. One is the same Ziyarat prescribed for 1st Rajab and another one is that which is narrated by Shaykh Kafami (r.a.) in ‘Baladul Ameen’ from Imam Sadiq (a.s.).

It is related from Imam Muhammed Taqi (a.s.) that:
One who performs the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on the 23rd night of the month of Ramazaan - which is hoped is the Shab-e-Qadr and on which night destinies are decided - he shakes hands with 24000 Angels and souls of prophets (a.s.). All of them seek Allah’s permission to perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on this night.

In another tradition it is related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that:
When Shab-e-Qadr arrives a caller calls out from the seventh heaven that Allah has forgiven every one who comes for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.).
In one tradition it is said that:

One who is at the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) on Shab-e- Qadr and recites 2 rakats prayer and asks Allah for Paradise and seeks refuge of Allah from hell fire, Allah accepts his request and gives him refuge from hell-fire.
Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that:
One who goes for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) during the month of Ramazaan and dies on the way, there would be no accounting for him and he would be told to enter Paradise unhesitantly.
But those words through which one should recite the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) in Shab-e-Qadr are in the way related by Shaykh Mufeed (a.r.), Mohammad bin Mashhadi (r.a.) and Ibne Taaoos (a.r.) in the book of “Mazaar”. Regarding the special Ziyarat of two Eids, Shaykh Mohammad Mashhadi (r.a.) has related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that he (a.s.) said:
When you decide to perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) do the ghusl and wear clean and ritually pure clothes and go to the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) stand facing the grave with your back towards Qibla and recite:

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ رَسُولِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ الصِّديقَةِ الطّاهِرَةِ فاطِمَةَ سَيِّدَةِ نِساءِ الْعالَمينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا مَوْلايَ اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ اَقَمْتَ الصَّلاةَ وَآتَيْتَ الزَّكاةَ وَاَمَرْتَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَنَهَيْتَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ، وَتَلَوْتَ الْكِتابَ حَقَّ تِلاوَتِهِ وَجاهَدْتَ فِي اللهِ حَقَّ جِهادِهِ وَصَبَرْتَ عَلَى الاَْذى فِي جَنْبِهِ مُحْتَسِباً حَتّى اَتاكَ الْيَقينُ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّ الَّذينَ خالَفُوكَ وَحارَبُوكَ وَالَّذينَ خَذَلُوكَ وَالَّذينَ قَتَلُوكَ مَلْعُونُونَ عَلى لِسانِ النَّبِيِّ الاُْمّي وَقَدْ خابَ مَنِ افْتَرى، لَعَنَ اللهُ الظّالِمينَ لَكُمْ مِنَ الاَْوَّلينَ وَالاْخِرينَ وَضاعَفَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَذابَ الاَْليمَ، اَتَيْتُكَ يا مَوْلايَ يَا بْنَ رَسُولِ اللهِ زائِراً عارِفاً بِحَقِّكَ مُوالِياً لاَِوْلِيائِكَ مُعادِياً لاَِعْدائِكَ، مُسْتَبْصِراً بِالْهُدَى الّذي أَنْتَ عَلَيْهِ، عارِفاً بِضَلالَةِ مَنْ خالَفَكَ، فَاشْفَعْ لي عِنْدَ رَبِّكَ

Pray for whatever you desire. Then perform the Ziyarat of the martyrs in such a way that from the footside you bend towards the Qibla and say:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ اَيُّهَا الصِّدّيقُونَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ اَيُّهَا الشُّهَداءُ الصّابِرُونَ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمْ جاهَدْتُمْ فِي سَبيلِ اللهِ وَصَبَرْتُمْ عَلَى الاَْذى فِي جَنْبِ اللهِ، وَنَصَحْتُمْ للهِ وَلِرَسُولِهِ حَتّى اَتاكُمُ الْيَقينُ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكُمْ اَحْياءٌ عِنْدَ رَبِّكُمْ تُرْزَقُونَ، فَجَزاكُمُ اللهُ عَنِ الاِْسْلامِ وَاَهْلِهِ اَفْضَلَ جَزاءِ الُْمحْسِنينَ، وَجَمَعَ بَيْنَنا وَبَيْنَكُمْ فِي مَحَلِّ النَّعيمِ

Recite the Ziyarat of Hazrat Abbas (a.s.) in his shrine and if one is at a distance one should imagine it:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا بْنَ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الْعَبْدُ الصّالِحُ الْمُطيعُ للهِ وَلِرَسُولِهِ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ جاهَدْتَ وَنَصَحْتَ وَصَبَرْتَ حَتّى اَتاكَ الْيَقينُ، لَعَنَ اللهُ الظّالِمينَ لَكُمْ مِنَ الاَْوَّلينَ وَالاْخِرينَ وَاَلْحَقَهُمْ بِدَرْكِ الْجَحيمِ

Then one should go in his Masjid and recite as many recommended prayers as one wants and after that come back.""",

            """We should know that many traditions have been recorded on the importance of the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on the eve of 1st of the month of Ramazaan, eve of 15th of the month of Ramazaan,end of the month of Ramazaan and specially the Shab-e-Qadr. It is related from Imam Muhammed Taqi (a.s.) that:

One who performs the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on
the 23rd night of the month of Ramazaan - which is
hoped is the Shab-e-Qadr and on which night destinies
are decided - he shakes hands with 24000 Angels and
souls of prophets (a.s.). All of them seek Allah’s permission
to perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on this night.

In another tradition it is related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that:

When Shab-e-Qadr arrives a caller calls out from the
seventh heaven that Allah has forgiven every one who
comes for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.).

In one tradition it is said that:

One who is at the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) on Shab-eQadr and recites 2 rakats prayer and asks Allah for
Paradise and seeks refuge of Allah from hell fire, Allah accepts his request and gives him refuge from hell-fire.

Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has narrated from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that:

One who goes for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) during the month of Ramazaan and dies on the way, there would be no accounting for him and he would be told to enter Paradise unhesitantly.

But those words through which one should recite the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) in Shab-e-Qadr are in the way related by Shaykh Mufeed (a.r.), Mohammad bin Mashhadi (r.a.) and Ibne Taaoos (a.r.) in the book of “Mazaar”. Regarding the special Ziyarat of two Eids,Shaykh Mohammad Mashhadi (r.a.) has related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that he (a.s.) said: 

When you decide to perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain(a.s.) do the ghusl and wear clean and ritually pure clothes and go to the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) stand facing the grave with your back towards Qibla and recite: 

Peace be upon you, O son of Allah’s Messenger. Peace be upon you,O son of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O son
of the veracious, immaculate lady Fatemah the Doyenne of the women of the world. Peace be upon you, O my master AbuAbdullah. So be upon you Allah’s mercy and blessings. I bear
witness that you performed the prayers, defrayed the poor-rate,enjoined the right, forbade the wrong, recited the Book (i.e. the
Holy Qur’an) as exactly as it should be recited, strove for the sake of Allah as exactly as striving must be, and faced all troubles
steadfastly for His sake, seeking his reward, until death came upon you. I also bear witness that those who dissented you, those who
fought against you, those who let you down, and those who slew you (all those) were accursed directly by the Meccan Prophet. 

And he who forges lies indeed fails to attain his desire. May Allah curse those who wronged you from amongst the past and the present
generations. May Allah also double for them the painful torment. O my master and son of Allah’s Messenger, I have come to you visiting
you, acknowledging the standing that you enjoy, declaring my loyalty to those who are loyal to you, renouncing your enemies,seeking to follow the true guidance that you are following, and recognizing the deviation of those who oppose you; so, (please) intercede for me before your Lord. 

On the head side say: 

Peace be upon you, O Argument of Allah in His lands and heavens.May Allah bless your immaculate spirit and your pure body. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O my master. 

Then go towards the head and pray 2 rakats namaz, then recite 2 more rakats and go to the footside and recite the Ziyarat of Hazrat Ali Akbar (a.s.): 

Peace be upon you, O my master and son of my master. So be upon you Allah’s mercy and blessings. May Allah curse those who wronged you. May Allah curse those who slew you. May Allah double the painful chastisement for them. 

Pray for whatever you desire. Then perform the Ziyarat of the martyrs in such a way that from the footside you bend towards the Qibla and say: 

Peace be upon you, O veracious ones. Peace be upon you, O steadfast martyrs. I bear witness that you strove in the way of Allah,acted patiently against harm for the sake of Allah, and did sincerely for the sake of Allah and His Messenger until death came upon you. I bear witness that you are alive and are being provided sustenance from your Lord. May Allah reward you with the best reward of the good-doers on behalf of Islam and its people and may He join us to you in the abode of bliss.  

Recite the Ziyarat of Hazrat Abbas (a.s.) in his shrine and if one is at a distance one should imagine it: 

Peace be upon you, O son of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O righteous servant (of Allah) and obedient to Allah and to His Messenger. I bear witness that you strove (in the way of Allah), acted sincerely, and tolerated (harm) until death came upon you. May Allah curse those who wronged you from the past and the present generations and may He send them to the lowest layer of the blazing Hell.

Then one should go in his Masjid and recite as many recommended prayers as one wants and after that come back.

            """There are countless traditions about the importance and reward of the Ziyarat on the day of Arafah. We just narrate some of them in the interest of the people going for Ziyarat. According to a reliable chain, Basheer bin Dahhaan says: I said to Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.), “Sometimes I cannot perform Hajj and spend the day of Arafah near Imam Husain’s (a.s.) grave.” Imam (a.s.) replied,
“O Basheer, you perform a good deed! If a believer, knowing the right of Imam Husain (a.s.) goes for his Ziyarat on the day of Arafah he gets the reward of twenty accepted Hajjs and twenty accepted Umrahs. And the reward of twenty Holy Wars (Jihad) along with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) or a Just Imam (a.s.). And one who does the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on the day of Eid, Allah gives him the reward of hundred Hajjs, hundred Umrahs and hundred Jihads fought with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) or a Just Imam (a.s.). Also one who performs the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on the day of Arafah having his recognition, Allah rewards him for a thousand Hajjs, thousand Umrahs and thousand Jihads along with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) or a Just Imam (a.s.).”
I asked, “Where can I get the reward of the place of Arafah?” Imam (a.s.) looked at me like a furious man and said,
“When a believer goes for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on the day of Arafah, performs Ghusl in Euphrates and goes towards the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.), he gets the reward of a Hajj which includes all the rites for each step. 
I think the Imam also said: and of Umrah also. According to many reliable traditions, Allah first looks at the people doing Ziyarat near the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) with mercy then at the people halting at Arafah. According to a reliable tradition from Rafa’ah, Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) asked me,
“Did you perform Hajj this year?”
I said, “May I be sacrificed on you, I did not have enough money for Hajj. But I spent the day of Arafah near the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.).” Imam (a.s.) said,
“O Rafa’ah! You did not do anything less than what the people at Mina did. If I would not have feared that people would cease performing Hajj, I would surely have narrated to you such a tradition that you would never have missed the Ziyarat of the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.).”
He remained silent for a while and then said,
“My father said to me that one who goes to the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) knowing his right without any pride has a thousand angels to his left as well as the right. And the reward of thousand Hajjs and thousand Umrahs performed along with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) or his successor is written for him.”
Honorable religious scholars have explained the method of the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.). One who intends to do the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) should perform Ghusl in Euphrates, if possible, or with any other water and wear purified clothes. He should then go for Ziyarat with tranquility, dignity and calmness. He should say, ‘ALLAAHO AKBAR’ upon reaching the gate of the shrine. Then say:
اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ كَبيراً وَاَلْحَمْدُ للهِ كَثيراً وَسُبْحانَ اللهِ بُكْرَةً وَاَصيلاً، وَالْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذي هَدانا لِهذا وَما كُنّا لِنَهْتَدِىَ لَوْلا اَنْ هَدانَا اللهُ، لَقَدْ جاءَتْ رُسُلُ رَبِّنا بِالْحَقِّ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى رَسُولِ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى فاطِمَةَ الزَّهْراءِ سَيِّدَةِ نِساءِ الْعالَمينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَى الْحَسَنِ وَالْحُسَيْنِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى عَلِيِّ بْنِ الْحُسَيْنِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَليِّ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى جَعْفَرِ بْنِ مُحَمَّد، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى مُوسَى بْنِ جَعْفَر، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى عَلِيِّ بْنِ مُوسى، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَلِيِّ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى عَلِيِّ بْنِ مُحَمَّد، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَى الْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِيِّ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَى الْخَلَفِ الصّالِحِ الْمُنْتَظَرِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ رَسُولِ اللهِ، عَبْدُكَ وَابْنُ عَبْدِكَ وَابْنُ اَمَتِكَ الْمُوالي لِوَلِيِّكَ الْمُعادي لِعَدُوِّكَ اسْتَجارَ بِمَشْهَدِكَ وَتَقَرَّبَ اِلَى اللهِ بِقَصْدِكَ، اَلْحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذي هَداني لِوِلايَتِكَ وَخَصَّني بِزِيارَتِكَ وَسَهَّلَ لي قَصْدَكَ

Then he should enter the shrine and standing opposite the head recite:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ آدَمَ صَفْوَةِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ نُوح نَبِيِّ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ اِبْراهيمَ خَليلِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ مُوسى كَليمِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ عيسى روُحِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ مُحَمَّد حَبيبِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وارِثَ فاطِمَةَ الزَّهْراءِ، السَّلامُ عَلَيكَ يا بنَ محَمَّد المُصطَفى ، السَّلامُ علَيْكَ يا بنَ عليِّ المُرتَضى، السَلامُ عَلَيكَ يا بنَ فاطِمَةَ الزَهْراءِ، السَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ خَديجَةَ الْكُبْرى، اَالسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا ثارَ اللهِ وَابْنَ ثارِهِ وَالْوِتْرَ الْمَوْتُورَ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قَدْ اَقَمْتَ الصَّلاةَ، وَآتَيْتَ الزَّكاةَ، وَاَمَرْتَ بِالْمَعْروُفِ، وَنَهَيْتَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ، وَاَطَعْتَ اللهَ حَتّى اَتاكَ الْيَقينُ، فَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً قَتَلَتْكَ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً ظَلَمَتْكَ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً سَمِعَتْ بِذلِكَ فَرَضِيَتْ بِهِ، يا مَوْلايَ يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ اُشْهِدُ اللهَ وَمَلائِكَتَهُ وَاَنْبِيائَهُ وَرُسُلَهُ اَنّي بِكُمْ مُؤْمِنٌ وَبِاِيابِكُمْ، مُوقِنٌ بِشَرايِعِ ديني وَخَواتيمِ عَمَلي وَمُنْقَلَبي اِلى رَبّي، فَصَلَواتُ اللهَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَلى اَرْواحِكُمْ وَعَلى اَجْسادِكُمْ وَعَلى شاهِدِكُمْ وَعَلى غائِبُكُمْ وَظاهِرِكُمْ وَباطِنِكُمْ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ خاتَمَ النَّبِيّينَ وَابْنَ سَيِّدِ الْوَصِيّينَ وَابْنَ اِمامِ الْمُتَّقينَ وَابْنَ قائِدِ الْغُرِّ الُْمحَجَّلينَ اِلى جَنّاتِ النَّعيمِ، وَكَيْفَ لا تَكُونُ كَذلِكَ وَاَنْتَ بابُ الْهُدى وَاِمامُ التُّقى وَالْعُرْوَةُ الْوُثْقى وَالْحُجَّةُ عَلى اَهْلِ الدُّنْيا وَخامِسُ اَصْحابِ الْكِساءِ غَذَّتْكَ يَدُ الرَّحْمَةِ، وَرَضَعْتَ مِنْ ثَدْىِ الاْيمانِ، وَرُبّيتَ فِي حِجْرِ الاِْسْلامِ، فَالنَّفْسُ غَيْرُ راضِيَة بِفِراقِكَ وَلا شاكَّة فِي حَياتِكَ صَلَواتُ اللهِ عَلَيْك وَعَلى آبائِكَ وَاَبْنائِكَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا صَريعَ الْعَبْرَةِ السّاكِبَةِ، وَقَرينَ الْمُصيبَةِ الرّاتِبَةِ، لَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً اسْتَحَلَّتْ مِنْكَ الَْمحارِمَ وانْتَهَكَتْ فِيكَ حُرمَةَ الاسلامِ، فَقُتِلْتَ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْكَ مَقْهُوراً، وَاَصْبَحَ رَسُولُ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ بِكَ مَوْتُوراً، وَاَصْبَحَ كِتابُ اللهِ بِفَقْدِكَ مَهْجُوراً، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ وَعَلى جَدِّكَ وَاَبيكَ وَاُمِّكَ وَاَخيكَ وَعَلَى الاَْئِمَّةِ مِنْ بَنيكَ، وَعَلَى الْمُسْتَشْهَدينَ مَعَكَ وَعَلَى الْمَلائِكَةِ الْحافّينَ بِقَبْرِكَ وَالشّاهِدينَ لِزُوّارِكَ الْمُؤْمِنينَ بِالْقَبُولِ عَلى دُعاءِ شيعَتِكَ، وَاَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ بِاَبي اَنْتَ وَاُمّي يَا بْنَ رَسُولِ اللهِ، بِاَبي اَنْتَ وَاُمّي يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ، لَقَدْ عَظُمَتِ الرِّزِيَّةُ وَجَلَّتِ الْمُصيبَةُ بِكَ عَلَيْنا وَعَلى جَميعِ اَهْلِ السَّماواتِ وَالاَْرْضِ، فَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً اَسْرَجَتْ وَاَلْجَمَتْ وَتَهَيَّأَتْ لِقِتالِكَ، يا مَوْلايَ يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ قَصَدْتُ حَرَمَكَ وَاَتَيْتُ مَشْهَدَكَ اَسْألُ اللهَ بِالشَّأْنِ الَّذي لَكَ عِنْدَهُ وَبِالَْمحَلِّ الَّذي لَكَ لَدَيْهِ اَنْ يُصَلِّىَ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد وَاَنْ يَجْعَلَني مَعَكُمْ فِي الدُّنْيا وَالاْخِرَةِ بِمَنِّهِ وَجُودِهِ وَكَرَمِهِ

Kiss the shrine and recite 2 rakats namaz above the head and in those 2 rakats he has the choice of reciting any surah after surah Hamd and after completing the same he should recite:
اَللّـهُمَّ اِنّي صَلَّيْتُ وَرَكَعْتُ وَسَجَدْتُ لَكَ وَحْدَكَ لا شَريكَ لَكَ، لاَِنَّ الصَّلاةَ وَالرُّكُوعَ وَالسُّجُودَ لا تَكُونُ اِلاّ لَكَ لاَِنَّكَ اَنْتَ اللهُ لا اِلـهَ اِلاّ اَنْتَ، اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد وَاَبْلِغْهُمْ عَنّي اَفْضَلَ التَّحِيَّةِ وَالسَّلامِ، وَارْدُدُ عَلَيَّ مِنْهُمُ التَّحِيَّةَ وَالسَّلامَ، اَللّـهُمَّ وَهاتانِ الرَّكْعَتانِ هَدِيَّةٌ مِنّي اِلى مَوْلايَ وَسَيِّدي وَاِمامي الْحُسَيْنِ ابْنِ عَلِيِّ عَلَيْهِمَا السَّلامُ، اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد وَتَقَبَّلْ ذلِكَ مِنّي، وَاجْزِني عَلى ذلِكَ اَفْضَلَ اَمَلي وَرَجائي فيكَ وَفِي وَلِيِّكَ يا اَرْحَمَ الرّاحِمينَ

Then he should get up and go to the foot of Imam Husain (a.s.) and recite the Ziyarat of Ali bin Husain (Janab Ali Akbar) (a.s.) and his head is near the blessed feet of Abu Abdillah (a.s.). Recite the following:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ رَسُولِ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ نَبِيِّ اللهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ الْحُسَيْنِ الشَّهيدِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الشَّهيدُ ابْنُ الشَّهيدِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ اَيُّهَا الْمَظْلُومُ ابْنُ الْمَظْلُومِ، لَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً قَتَلَتْكَ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً ظَلَمَتْكَ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً سَمِعَتْ بِذلِكَ فَرَضِيَتْ بِهِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا مَوْلايَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وَلِيَّ اللهِ وَابْنَ وَلِيِّهِ، لَقَدْ عَظُمَتِ الْمُصيبَةُ وَجَلَّتِ الرَّزِيَّةُ بِكَ عَلَيْنا وَعَلى جَميعِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، فَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً قَتَلَتْكَ وَاَبْرَأُ اِلَى اللهِ وَاِلَيْكِ مِنْهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيا وَالاْخِرَةِ 

After this recite the Ziyarat of the martyrs of Kerbala:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يا اَوْلِياءَ اللهِ وَاَحِبّاءَهُ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يا اَصْفِياءَ اللهِ وَاَوِدّاءَهُ اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يا اَنْصارَ دينِ اللهِ وَاَنْصارَ نَبِيّهِ وَاَنْصارَ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ وَاَنْصارَ فاطِمَةَ سَيِّدَةِ نِساءِ الْعالَمينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يا اَنْصارَ اَبي مُحَمَّد الْحَسَنِ الْوَلِيِّ النّاصِحِ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ يا اَنْصارَ أبي عَبْدِاللهِ الْحُسَيْنِ الشَّهيدِ الْمَظْلُومِ صَلَواتُ اللهِ عَلَيْهِمْ اَجْمَعينَ، بِاَبي اَنْتُمْ وَاُمّي طِبْتُمْ وَطابَتِ الاَْرْضُ الَّتي فيها دُفِنْتُمْ، وَفُزْتُمْ وَاللهِ فَوْزاً عَظيماً، يا لَيْتَني كُنْتُ مَعَكُمْ فَاَفُوزُ مَعَكُمْ فِي الْجِنانِ مَعَ الشُّهَداءِ وَالصّالِحينَ وَحَسُنَ اُولئِكَ رَفيقاً، وَالسَّلامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ

Then he should go at the head side of Imam Husain (a.s.) and pray for his family members and believers as much as possible. Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) says that from there he should go to the shrine of Hazrat Abbas (a.s.) and standing at the purified grave he should recite as follows:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبَا الْفَضْلِ الْعِبّاسَ بْنَ اَميرَ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ سَيِّدِ الْوَصِيّينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يَا بْنَ اَوَّلِ الْقَوْمِ اِسْلاماً وَاَقْدَمِهِمْ ايماناً وَاَقْوَمِهِمْ بِدينِ اللهِ وَاَحْوَطِهِمْ عَلَى الاِْسْلامِ، اَشْهَدُ لَقَدْ نَصَحْتَ للهِ وَلِرَسُولِهِ وَلاَِخيكَ فَنِعْمَ الاَْخُ الْمُواسي، فَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً قَتَلَتْكَ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةٌ ظَلَمَتْكَ، وَلَعَنَ اللهُ اُمَّةً اسْتَحَلَّتْ مِنْكَ الَْمحارِمَ وَانْتَهَكَتْ فِي قَتْلِكَ حُرْمَةَ الاِْسْلامِ، فَنِعْمَ الاَْخُ الصّابِرُ الُْمجاهِدُ الُْمحامِي النّاصِرُ وَالاَْخُ الدّافِعُ عَنْ اَخيهِ الُْمجيبُ اِلى طاعَةِ رَبِّهِ، الرّاغِبُ فيـما زَهِدَ فيهِ غَيْرُهُ مِنَ الثَّوابِ الْجَزيلِ وَالثَّناءِ الْجَميلِ، وَاَلْحَقَكَ اللهُ بِدَرَجَةِ آبائِكَ فِي دارِ النَّعيمِ اِنَّهُ حَميدٌ مَجيدٌ

Then he should throw himself on the grave and say:

Then he should throw himself on the grave and say:
اَللّـهُمَّ لَكَ تَعَرَّضْتُ وَلِزِيارَةِ اَوْلِيائِكَ قَصَدْتُ، رَغْبَةً فِي ثَوابِكَ وَرَجاءً لِمَغْفِرَتِكَ وَجَزيلِ اِحْسانِكَ، فَاَسْاَلُكَ اَنْ تُصَلِّيَ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِ مُحَمَّد، وَاَنْ تَجْعَلَ رِزْقي بِهِمْ دارّاً، وَعَيْشي بِهِمْ قارّاً، وَزِيارَتي بِهِمْ مَقْبُولَةً، وَذَنْبي بِهِمْ مَغْفُوراً، وَاقْلِبْني بِهُمْ مُفْلِحاً مُنْجِحاً مُسْتَجاباً دُعائي بِاَفْضَلِ ما يَنْقَلِبُ بِهِ اَحَدٌ مِنْ زُوّارِهِ وَالْقاصِدينَ اِلَيْهِ بِرَحْمَتِكَ يا اَرْحَمَ الرّاحِمينَ""",

            """There are countless traditions about the importance and reward of
the Ziyarat on the day of Arafah. We just narrate some of them in
the interest of the people going for Ziyarat. According to a reliable
chain, Basheer bin Dahhaan says: I said to Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq
(a.s.), “Sometimes I cannot perform Hajj and spend the day of
Arafah near Imam Husain’s (a.s.) grave.” Imam (a.s.) replied,

“O Basheer, you perform a good deed! If a believer,
knowing the right of Imam Husain (a.s.) goes for his
Ziyarat on the day of Arafah he gets the reward of twenty
accepted Hajjs and twenty accepted Umrahs. And the
reward of twenty Holy Wars (Jihad) along with the Holy
Prophet (s.a.w.s.) or a Just Imam (a.s.). And one who does
the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on the day of Eid, Allah gives him the reward of hundred Hajjs, hundred Umrahs
and hundred Jihads fought with the Holy Prophet(s.a.w.a.) or a Just Imam (a.s.). Also one who performs the
Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on the day of Arafah having his recognition, Allah rewards him for a thousand Hajjs,
thousand Umrahs and thousand Jihads along with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) or a Just Imam (a.s.).” 

I asked, “Where can I get the reward of the place of Arafah?” Imam(a.s.) looked at me like a furious man and said,

“When a believer goes for the Ziyarat of Imam Husain
(a.s.) on the day of Arafah, performs Ghusl in Euphrates
and goes towards the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.), he gets
the reward of a Hajj which includes all the rites for each
step.

I think the Imam also said: and of Umrah also. According to many
reliable traditions, Allah first looks at the people doing Ziyarat near
the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) with mercy then at the people
halting at Arafah. According to a reliable tradition from Rafa’ah,
Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq (a.s.) asked me,

“Did you perform Hajj this year?”

I said, “May I be sacrificed on you, I did not have enough money for
Hajj. But I spent the day of Arafah near the grave of Imam Husain
(a.s.).” Imam (a.s.) said,

“O Rafa’ah! You did not do anything less than what the
people at Mina did. If I would not have feared that people
would cease performing Hajj, I would surely have
narrated to you such a tradition that you would never
have missed the Ziyarat of the grave of Imam Husain(a.s.).” 

He remained silent for a while and then said,

“My father said to me that one who goes to the Ziyarat of
Imam Husain (a.s.) knowing his right without any pride
has a thousand angels to his left as well as the right. And
the reward of thousand Hajjs and thousand Umrahs performed along with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) or his successor is written for him.”

Honorable religious scholars have explained the method of the
Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.). One who intends to do the Ziyarat of
Imam Husain (a.s.) should perform Ghusl in Euphrates, if possible,
or with any other water and wear purified clothes. He should then
go for Ziyarat with tranquility, dignity and calmness. He should
say, ‘ALLAAHO AKBAR’ upon reaching the gate of the shrine. Then say:

Allah is the Most Great of all. All praise be to Allah very much. Glory be to Allah in mornings and evenings. All praise be to Allah Who has guided us to this. We would not have been guided if Allah had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord have indeed come with the truth. Peace be upon the Messenger of Allah, peace of Allah be upon him and his Household. Peace be upon the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon Fatemah the luminous and the doyenne of all women of the world. Peace be upon al-Hasan and al-Husayn.Peace be upon Ali the son of al-Husayn. Peace be upon Muhammad the son of Ali. Peace be upon Ja’far the son of Muhammad. Peace be upon Musa the son of Ja’far. Peace be upon Ali the son of Musa.

Peace be upon Muhammad the son of Ali. Peace be upon Ali the son of Muhammad. Peace be upon al-Hasan the son of Ali. Peace be
upon the virtuous Successor and Awaited. Peace be upon you, O Aba-Abdillah. Peace be upon you, O son of Allah’s Messenger. I – the servant of you and the son of your servant and your bondwoman,who is loyal to those who are loyal to you and enemy of those who are your enemies – am seeking the shelter of your shrine and seeking nearness to Allah through directing to you. All praise be to Allah Who guided me to be loyal to you, Who conferred upon me with my visiting you, and Who made easy for me to direct to you. 

Then he should enter the shrine and standing opposite the head recite:

Peace be upon you, O inheritor of Adam the chosen by Allah. Peace
be upon you, O inheritor of Noah the prophet of Allah. Peace be
upon you, O inheritor of Abraham the friend of Allah. Peace be upon
you, O inheritor of Moses the spoken by Allah. Peace be upon you, O
inheritor of Jesus the spirit of Allah. Peace be upon you, O inheritor
of Muhammad the most beloved by Allah. Peace be upon you, O
inheritor of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O
inheritor of Fatemah the luminous. Peace be upon you, O son of
Muhammad the well-chosen prophet. Peace be upon you, O son of
Ali the well-pleased. Peace be upon you, O son of Fatemah the
luminous. Peace be upon you, O son of Khadijah the grand lady.
Peace be upon you, O vengeance of Allah and son of His vengeance
and the unavenged sanctity.I bear witness that you performed the
prayers, defrayed the poor-rates, enjoined the right, forbade the
wrong, and obeyed Allah until death came upon you. May Allah
curse the people who slew you. May Allah curse the people who
wronged you. May Allah curse the people who were informed about
that but they approved it. O my master! O Abu-Abdillah! I call Allah,
His angels, His Prophets, and His Messengers to witness that I
believe in you and in your Return and I have faith in the laws of my
religion and in the sealing deeds of mine, and in my final return to
my Lord. Allah’s blessings be upon you all, upon your souls, upon
your bodies, upon the present and the absent (of your group), and
upon the manifest and the hidden (of your affairs). Peace be upon
you, O son of the Seal of Prophets, son of the chief of the Prophets’

successors, son of the leader of the pious, and son of the whiteforehead, marked believers. How can that you be anything other
than this while you are the door to the true guidance, the guide to
piety, the firmest handle, the argument against the inhabitants of
this world, and the fifth of the People of the Cloak. You were
nourished by the hand of mercy, breast-fed by the bosom of faith,
and brought up in the lap of Islam. So, my soul is definitely
displeased by the way you left this world and it has no doubt that
you are alive. Allah’s blessings be upon you, your ascendants, and
your descendants. Peace be upon you, O object of the pouring tears
and match of the astounding misfortune. May Allah curse the
people who violated your sanctities and infringed the holiness of
Islam. So, you – may Allah’s blessings be upon you – were killed
overwhelmed, the Messenger of Allah, Allah’s blessings be upon
him and his Household, became cut off because of loss of you, and
the Book of Allah became deserted due to losing you. Peace be upon
you, your grandfather, your father, your mother, your brother, the
Imams from your descendants, those who were martyred with you,
and the angels who are surrounding your tomb, witnessing for your
visitors, and praying for the acceptance of the prayers of your
adherents. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you. -

May my father and mother be ransoms for you, O son of Allah’s Messenger. May my father and mother be ransoms for you, O AbuAbdillah. So unbearable is the misfortune and so horrendous is the
calamity of you for us and for all the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. May Allah curse the people who put saddles and reins on
their animals and readied themselves for fighting against you. O my master! O Abu-Abdillah! I have directed to your sanctuary and I have
come to your shrine asking Almighty Allah in the name of the standing that you enjoy with Him and in the name of the position
that you occupy with him to send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and to include me with your group in this world and in the Hereafter, out of His favor, magnanimity, and generosity

Kiss the shrine and recite 2 rakats namaz above the head and in those 2 rakats he has the choice of reciting any surah after surah Hamd and after completing the same he should recite: 

O Allah, I have offered a prayer, genuflected, and prostrated myself for Your sake purely without setting any partner with You, since all prayers, genuflections, and prostrations suit none except You.Because You are Allah; there in no god save You. O Allah, (please) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad,convey to them my best greetings and compliments, and convey to me their replies to my greetings and compliments. O Allah, these two units of prayer are present from me to my master, chief, and leader, al-Husayn the son of Ali, peace be upon both of them. O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad and accept that from me and reward me for it in the best rewarding that I anticipate and hope from You and from Your saint. O most merciful of all those who show mercy!

Then he should get up and go to the foot of Imam Husain (a.s.) and recite the Ziyarat of Ali bin Husain (Janab Ali Akbar) (a.s.) and his head is near the blessed feet of Abu Abdillah (a.s.). Recite the following:

Peace be upon you, O son of Allah’s Messenger. Peace be upon you,O son of Allah’s Prophet. Peace be upon you, O son of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O son of al-Husayn the martyr. Peace be upon you, O martyr and son of the martyr. Peace be upon you, O persecuted and son of the persecuted. May Allah curse the people who slew you. May Allah curse the people who wronged you. May Allah curse the people who were informed of that and they approved it. Peace be upon you, O my master.Peace be upon you, O Allah’s friend and son of His friend

Unbearable is the misfortune and so horrendous is the calamity of you for us and for all faithful believers. May Allah curse the people who slew you. I release myself in the presence of Allah and you from these people in this world and in the Hereafter

After this recite the Ziyarat of the martyrs of Kerbala: 

Peace be upon you, O Allah’s friends and beloved by him. Peace be upon you, O choices of Allah and His favorites. Peace be upon you, O supporters of Allah’s Religion, supporters of His Prophet,supporters of the Commander of the Faithful, and supporters of Fatemah the doyenne of the women of the world. Peace be upon you, O supporters of Abu-Muhammad al-Hasan the sincere saint.

Peace be upon you, O supporters of Abu-Abdullah al-Husayn the wronged martyr. Blessings of Allah be upon them all. May my father
and mother be your ransoms. Pure are you, and pure is the soil in
which you were buried. And, by Allah, great is your triumph. I wish I
were with you so that I would have won with you in the gardens of
Paradise with the martyrs and the righteous. Excellent is the
companionship of these. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you all.

Then he should go at the head side of Imam Husain (a.s.) and pray for his family members and believers as much as possible. Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) says that from there he should go to the shrine of Hazrat Abbas (a.s) and standing at the purified grave he should recite as follows: 

Peace be upon you, O Abul-Fazl al-Abbas son of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O son of the chief of the Prophets successors. Peace be upon you, O son of the foremost in accepting Islam, the leading in having faith in it, the most perfect in carrying out the laws of Allah’s religion, and the most careful for Islam. I bear witness that you have acted sincerely for the sake of Allah, His Messenger, and your brother. So, how excellent sacrificing brother you are! May Allah curse the people who slew you. 

May Allah curse the people who wronged you. May Allah curse the people who violated your sanctities and infringed the holiness of Islam when they killed you. Most excellent steadfast, striver brother, defender,supporter, one who stood up for his brother, one who responded to the obedience to his Lord, and one who desired for what others deemed unworthy; namely, the abundant reward and the excellent praise you are. May Allah attach you to the rank of your ancestors in the Abode of Bliss.

Then he should throw himself on the grave and say: 

O Allah, I am presenting myself before You and I am intending to visit your intimate servants, for I desire for gaining Your reward and the Faithful. Peace be upon you, O son of the chief of the Prophets’ successors. Peace be upon you, O son of the foremost in accepting Islam, the leading in having faith in it, the most perfect in carrying out the laws of Allah’s religion, and the most careful for Islam. I bear witness that you have acted sincerely for the sake of Allah, His Messenger, and your brother. So, how excellent sacrificing brother you are! May Allah curse the people who slew you. 

May Allah curse the people who wronged you. May Allah curse the people who violated your sanctities and infringed the holiness of Islam when they killed you. Most excellent steadfast, striver brother, defender,supporter, one who stood up for his brother, one who responded to the obedience to his Lord, and one who desired for what others deemed unworthy; namely, the abundant reward and the excellent praise you are.

Then one should recite 2 rakat namaz and ask for whatever one likes and then he should come back.
Ninth Ziyarat: Day of Arabeen

It is the second Ziyarat which is narrated from Jaabir (r.a.) and its method is the same as related from Ata that he said: On 20th Safar we reached Ghazaryah with Jaabir Ibne Abdullah Ansari (r.a.). Jaabir (r.a.) did ghusl in Furaat and wore the ritually pure dress he had and said: O Ata! Do you have some perfume? I said: I have earthen musk. He took a little of it and applied it to his head and body. Then walking bare footed he went to the grave of Imam Husain (a.s.) and stood there. He recited ALLAAHO AKBARO thrice and fell down unconscious. When he regained consciousness, I heard that he was reciting:
…اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَلَ اللهِ
It is the same Ziyarat which is narrated for Rajab. Except for some words there is no difference, and those differences also pertain to different editions. The Late Shaykh (r.a.) has also given the same opinion. If one wants to recite it he can refer to the Ziyarat of 15th Rajab.
The writer says: Apart from these times, the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) is also beneficial to be recited on blessed days and nights and other times specially occasions associated with Imam Husain (a.s.), like Eid-e-Mubahela, day of descent of Surah Hal Ataa, his birthday and Friday eve. A tradition says that every night the Almighty showers His mercy on Imam Husain (a.s.) and sends all the prophets and legatees for his Ziyarat. Ibne Qulwayh (r.a.) has related from Imam Sadiq (a.s.) that 
One who does the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on every Friday eve would definitely be forgiven and he will not leave the world in a condition of regret, and in Paradise his place would be with Imam Husain (a.s.).
And it is there in the tradition of Amash that his neighbour told him: I dreamt that epistles are falling from the sky and on them is written the safety for people who perform the Ziyarat of Imam Husain (a.s.) on Friday eve.""",

Peace be on the favorite of Allah, Peace be on the beloved friend of Allah, His distinguished hero! Peace be on the choicest confidant of Allah, sincerely attached precisely like his father! Peace be on Hussain, who gave his life in the way of Allah, a martyr, underwent untold hardships Peace be on the hostage surrounded by thetightening circle of sorrow and grief, killed by a horde of savages. O my Allah I give witness that beyond a shadow of doubt he is Thy favorite and choicest confidant, who enjoys Thy confidence and favor, precisely like his father! Thou looked upto him and elected him in Thy cause, picked and chose him for the good fortune,selected for him the best purified parents, appointed him guardian,leader, and defender of rights, a true representative (inheritor and progenitor) of guardians, leaders and defenders of rights, gave him much and more from the inheritance of the Prophets, put him forward as a decisive argument, along with the other successors (of the Holy Prophet-the twelve lmams) to the mankind. 

He met with deadly dangers, acted justly and fairly, made use of everything belonging to him to pay full attention to give sincere advice, took pains, made every effort and put his heart, mind, soul and life at the disposal of Thy mission to liberate the people from the yoke of ignorance and evil of bewilderment, but an evildoer, deceived with empty hopes of mean and worthless worldly gains, had pressed 

heavily on him, and sold out his share (eternal bliss) for the meanest
and lowest bargain, betrayed his "day of judgment" for a vulgar
return, took pride in insolence, fell into the fathom- well of silly
stupid follies, provoked Thee and Thy Prophet to anger, did as the
harsh discordant, the hypocrite, the heavily burdened bearers of
sin, condemned to Hellfire, advised to him, however, he (the Holy
lmam), steadily, rightly and justly coped With them, till, in Thy
obedience, gave his life after which his family was set adrift. O my
Allah, therefore, condemn them to hell as a denunciation and
conviction; and crack-down on them with a painful Punishment.
Peace be on you O the son of the Messenger of Allah! Peace be on
you O the son of the first of the successors (of the Holy Prophet)! I
bear witness that Allah put faith in you like He had full confidence in
your father, and that you always looked for and collected good and
virtue, lived a highly praiseworthy life and departed from this world
a martyr, forsaken and abused; I bear witness that Allah will
promptly fulfill the promise, He made to you, and destroy those who
left you helpless and punish those who killed you; I bear witness
that you kept your promise made with Allah, and strived in His way
till what was certain came upon you, so curse of Allah be an those
who killed you, curse of Allah be on those who oppressed you, curse
of Allah be on the people who came to know and approved. 

O my Allah be my witness that I make friends with those who love him and oppose those who deny him. I, my father and mother, are at your disposal 0 the son of the Messenger of Allah. I know and bear witness that you were "light" in the sublime loins and in the pure wombs, never touched you the dirt of ignorance, nor ever obscurity concealed you in its folds; I bear witness that you are the pillar of "Deen", support of the Muslims, refuge of the faithful; I bear witness that you are a truthful, well-aware, content, intelligent, rightly guided guide (Imam); I bear witness that the Imams among your descendants are the symbols of "conscious piety" and signs of "true guidance", the "safe handle"-Islam, and the decisive arguments over mankind; I declare positively that I have full faith in you and I know for certain that you shall return.

            """Anyone approaching Baghdad from the north or the west will be impressed by the sight of the four golden minarets at Kazmayn, the Shrine of the Two Imams, Imam Musa al-Kazim (a.s.) and Imam Mohammad Taqi al-Jawad (a.s.). They are respectively the Seventh and the Ninth Imam. At whose tombs we are accustomed to seek healing and to invoke their intercession for the forgiveness of our sins and the fulfilment of our needs.

The present building dates back only to the beginning of the sixteenth century and has been kept in excellent repair. This building represents the restoration of Shah lsmail I (1502 - 24), though when the Turkish Sultan, Suleman the Great, captured Baghdad and remained there for four months in 1534 A.D., he visited this sacred place, and is said to have contributed to the further ornamentation of the Shrine at Kazmayn. The tiles for the double cupola, however, were provided in 1796 A.D. by Shah Agha Mohammad Khan, who was the first of the Persian Kadjar dynasty. In 1870 A.D., Nasr-al-Din Shah had these golden tiles repaired on one of the domes and on the minarets. It is interesting that the dates of all these alterations are clearly indicated by inscriptions.

If we bear in mind that the Two Imams (a.s.) who are buried here died in the beginning of the eighth century, it will be evident that there are seven hundred years of the history of their tomb to account for, previous to the comparatively modern restoration of Shah Ismail I. The Imams (a.s.) lived in the early days of Baghdad, while the walls of Mansur’s round city on the western side of the Tigris were still standing. There were cemeteries to the north-west that went by various names - that of the Syrian Gate, that of the Abbasids, and that of the Straw Gate. The Two Imams were buried immediately to the west of this latter cemetery, but by the time Yakubi wrote, the whole northern district was designated in a general way as the cemetery of the Kuraish. Both of these Imams were poisoned at the instigation of the reigning Caliphs, but it is significant that in the case of Imam Mohammad Taqi (a.s.), the funeral service was read by a representative of the royal family, which undoubtedly distinguised the Imam as an important person, at whose grave some sort of a mausoleum would be built. But as to the importance attached in the early times to the visit to this tomb, the only information available is on the authority of traditions that have been attributed to the Eighth and Tenth Imams (a.s.). These traditions are answers they are said to have given when they were asked by their followers concerning the merit of pilgrimage to Kazmayn. It is related that Imam Ali Reza (a.s.), whose life in Baghdad was during the caliphate of Haroon al- Rashid, told his Shia followers to say their prayers of salutation to his father, Imam Musa al-Kazim (a.s.), “Outside the walls of the Shrine, or in the nearby mosques,” if the Sunni authority and prejudice in Baghdad was too great for them to do so at the tomb itself. From this we infer that a building of some sort was recognised at that early date as marking the tomb of the Imam Musa (a.s.) and that it was surrounded by a wall. Further statements are said to have been made a few years later by Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.), whose period of Imamat began during the later part of the Caliphate of Mo’tasim, and who enjoyed greater indulgence that was shown to the Shias until the period of reaction against them and the Mu’tazalites under the Caliph Mutawakkil. The following particular instructions for visiting this Shrine have been given by Allamah Majlisi (r.a.).

When you wish to visit the tomb of Musa ibn Jafar (a.s.) and the tomb of Mohammad ibn Ali ibn Musa (a.s.), first you must bathe and make yourself clean, then anoint yourself with perfume and put on two clean garments, after which you are to say at the tomb of the Imam Musa: -
Peace be upon thee, O Friend of Allah!
Peace be upon thee, O Proof of Allah!
Peace be upon thee, O Light of Allah!
O Light in the dark place of the earth!
Peace be upon him whom Allah advances in thy regard,
Behold I come as a pilgrim, who acknowledges your right,
Who hates your enemies and befriends your friends,
So intercede for me therefore with your Lord.
“You are then free,”
said Imam Ali Naqi (a.s.),
“to ask for your personal needs, after which you should offer a prayer in salutation to Imam Mohammad Taqi (a.s.), using these same words.”

Allamah Majlisi (r.a.), who has included these traditions in his instructions for modern pilgrims to this Shrine, makes the observation in explanation of the unusual - brevity of the prescribed prayer, “that it was necessary in those times to take great care in dissimulation (taqiyah) that the Shias should not suffer injury.”

Another tradition that dates from the same century in which these two Imams died is attributed to a certain Hasan ibn Jamhur, who said:

“In the year 296 A.H., when Ali ibn Ahmad al-Furat was Vizier, I saw Ahmad ibn Rabi’, who was one of the Caliph’s writers, when his hand had gotten infected so that it had bad odour and turned black.

Everyone who saw him had no doubt that he would die. In a dream, however, he saw Hazrat Ali (a.s.), and said to him: “O Ameerul Momeneen, will you not ask Allah to give me my hand?”

Hazrat Ali (a.s.) answered,

‘go to Musa ibn Jafar and he will ask this for you from Allah.’

In the morning they got a litter and carpeted it, gave him a bath and anointed him with perfume. They had him lie down in the litter and covered him with a robe. Then they carried him to the tomb of Imam Musa (a.s.), whose intercession he sought in prayer. The afflicted man took some of the earth from the tomb and rubbed it on his arm upto the shoulder and then bound the arm up again. The next day, when he opened the bandage, he saw that all the skin and flesh of the arm had fallen off, and that only the bones and veins and ligaments remained, and the bad odour had also ceased. When the vizier heard of this he took the men to testify as what had happened. In a short time healthy flesh and skin grew back again, and he was able to resume his work of writing.”.

Allamah Majlisi (a.r.) adds the comment that “in every period there have been so many miracles and demonstrations of power (karaamat) at the tomb of these two saints that there is no need to describe cases of the past. In our own times there are so many instances occuring and recurring that to recount them would be a lengthy process.”
After the Abbasid caliphs had fallen more under the authority of the commanders of their armies of Turkish mercenaries, there was a rising of the Buyids (or Buwaihids) in Persia; and in 946 A.D. the Caliph Mustakfi was blinded by the Buyid Prince, Mo’izzu’d Dawla, who set up the blinded Caliph’s son, al-Muktaddir, as a nominal ruler while he exercised the actual authority himself. Ibn Asir has related that “the Buyids were fanatical adherents of Ali (a.s.) and firmly convinced that the Abbasids were usurpers of a throne that rightfully belonged to others.” They did not take over the Caliphate, but in addition to retaining for themselves the authority and perquisites of the government of the provinces, they proclaimed the first ten days of the month of Moharram as a period of public mourning for Imam Husain (a.s.), and they frequently enriched the sanctuary at Kazmayn with their gifts. The Caliph Tai’ is reported to have led the Friday prayers in the Kazmayn mosque, so that in the period of the revival of the Shia influence under the protection of the Buyids, we are certain that the Kazmayn Shrine was regularly visited by pilgrims and served as “the rallying place of the Shia party.”
It was during this period that the four great works of the Shia tradition were compiled. Shaikh Kulaini (r.a.) died in Baghdad in 939 A.D., after completing his monumental work, the Compendium of the Science of Religion (al-Kafi fi Ilm ad-din), which is perhaps the most highly esteemed of all the Shia source books. Ibn Baabwaih (r.a.) had come to Baghdad from Khorasan in 966 A.D., where he devoted himself to teaching and writing. His ‘Every Man His Own Lawyer’ (Kitab man laa yahzorohul Faqih), is also one of the four most authorative books on Shia law and tradition. And sixteen years after the death of Ibn Baabwayh (r.a.), Al-Tusi (a.s.) also came from Khorasan to teach in Baghdad, where he wrote the remaining two of the four great books of traditions that lie at the basis of Shia theology and jurisprudence, ‘The Correcting of judgments’ (Tahzeeb al-Ahkaam) and the ‘Examination of Differences in Traditions’ (Al-Istebsaar).
At this time of greater boldness on the part of the Shias, riots with the Sunnis were not infrequent in Baghdad. In one of these disturbances in 1051 A.D. the Sunni leader was killed in a fight that had ensued when the Shias ventured to put an inscription laudatory of Ali (a.s.) above one of the city gates. The indignation of the Sunnis was so great that in the tension of the situation after their leader’s funeral, they went as a mob into the Shrine of Kazmayn and plundered the tombs of the two Imams. After carrying off the gold and silver lamps and the curtains which adorned these sanctuaries, the rioters on the following day completed their work by setting fire to the buildings. The great teak-wood domes above the shrines of the Imams Musa and Mohammad (a.s.) were entirely burnt. This fact that the domes were at first of teak-wood has something to do doubtless with the number of times they were burned.
It was shortly after the burning of the Shrine in 1051 A.D. that the Seljuk Sultans displaced the Buwaihids as military dictators in Persia and “Protectors” of the Caliphs in Baghdad. They learned what they knew of Islam in the distinctively Sunni atmosphere of Bukhara. Nevertheless, when they came to Baghdad, no injury was done to the Shrine at Kazmayn. And when Sultan Malik Shah visited it in 1086, it had apparently been repaired from the damages of the fire of thirty-five years before. Ibn Jubayr, who gives a detailed description of Baghdad in 1184 A.D. in his Travels, mentions the tomb of Musa ibn Jafar (a.s.), but he does not speak of it as Kazmayn, and he makes no reference to the tomb of the Imam Mohammad Taqi (a.s.), which would suggest that Shia influence was at that time at such low ebb that this shrine, so close to the city of Baghdad had been abandoned as a place of regular pilgrimage.
Notwithstanding, before another hundred years had passed when the domes of the Shrines had again been destroyed by fire, we find that its repair was regarded as of sufficient importance to be the one and only enterprise that the shortlived Caliph Zaheer had been able to undertake. And Ibn Tiktaka who mentions this repair of the domes in his Kitab al-Fakhri, is known to have succeeded his father as supervisor of the sacred towns of the Shias in the vicinity of Baghdad, so that it is possible that the minority community, while by no means free, may have enjoyed certain prescribed and restricted rights. Their headquarters however, were no longer in Baghdad but in Hilla, and greater importance was given to Najaf and Kerbala as places of pilgrimage.
When the Mongols came with their overwhelming force in 1258 A.D., they wrought almost complete devastation in and around Baghdad. There is said to have been an understanding, however, that the holy cities of the Shias should be spared, and in fact Kazmayn was the only one of these shrines that suffered. This was perhaps to the destruction of the western part of the city first. It may have been during the subsequent siege of the fortress on the eastern side of the Tigris that the deputation of Shias from Hilla arrived and arranged with Halaaku Khan for the special protection of Najaf and Kerbala. However that may be, we know that the city of Baghdad was utterly ruined by the Mongols, and that the tombs of Kazmayn were burned. “Nearly all the inhabitants, to the number, according to Rashid ad-Din, of 800,000 (Makrizi says 2,000,000) perished, and thus passed away one of the noblest cities that had ever graced the East - the Cynosure of the Mohammadan world, where the luxury, wealth and culture of five centuries had been concentrated... The booty captured, we are told, was so great that Georgians and Tartars succumbed under the load of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, rich stuffs, gold and silver vessels, etc., while as to the vases from China and Kashan (i.e., procelain), and those made in the country of iron and copper, they were deemed scarcely of any value, and were broken and thrown away. The soldiers were so rich that the saddles of their horses and mules and their most ordinary utensils were inlaid with stones, pearls and gold. Some of them broke off their swords at the hilt and filled up the scabbards with gold, while others emptied the body of a Baghdadian, refilled it with gold, precious stones and pearls, and carried it off from the city.”
The death of the last of the Abbasid Caliphs, Mustasim, has been so celebrated in literature that what actually happened is obscure.
There are numerous accounts of how Hulaaku Khan was disgusted when he saw that in his avarice the Caliph had gathered gold which he had been unwilling to spend either in defence of the city or to effect favourable terms of capitulation. Marco Polo relates the story that when Halaaku Khan entered Baghdad he found to his astonishment a town that was filled with gold and silver, and in his indignation he gave orders that the avaricious Caliph should be “shut up in this same town, without sustenance; and there, in the midst of his wealth, he soon finished a miserable existence.”
This story is based on the narrative of Mirkhond, of Joinville, and of Makakia, the Armenian historian, and as Howarth remarks it has provided “one of those grim episodes which Longfellow delighted to put into verse”:
I said to the Caliph, “Thou art old,
Thou hast no need of so much gold;
Thou should’st not have heaped and hidden it here,
Till the breath of battle was hot and near,
But have sown through the land these useless hoards,
To spring into shining blades of swords,
And keep thine honour sweet and clear.”
Then into his dungeon I locked the drone,
And left him there to feed all alone,
In the honey cells of his golden hive;
Never a prayer, nor a cry, nor a groan,
Was heard from those massive walls of stone,
Nor again was the Caliph seen alive.
One notable fact in this connection is that the life of the Caliph’s vizier in Baghdad was spared. He was Muayid-ud-din Alkamiya who was known to have been favourable to the Shias, and who was also reported to have sent his submission to Halaaku, and had invited him to invade the country. However, this may be, the Caliph was put to death on the 21st February, 1258 A.D.. Wassaf and Novairi say he was rolled up in carpets and, then trodden under by horses so that his blood should not be spilt. This was in accordance with the ‘yasa’ of Jingis Khan, which forbade the shedding of the blood of royal persons.
But the Caliph’s vizier, whose life was spared, “retained his post as vizier, the reward doubtless of his dubious loyalty.” Various prominent Persians, as distinguished from Arabs or Turks were appointed to important positions in the new administration of affairs, and among the first buildings to be rebuilt was the Shrine of the two Imams, at Kazmayn. 
After the fall of the last of the Abbasid Caliph, Baghdad was never rebuilt on its former scale of grandeur. The Khans-II, who were the descendants of Halaaku, held the city for 82 years, not as a capital, however, but merely as the chief town of the province of Iraq. It was near the close of their period of authority that the traveller Mustawfi visited Baghdad (1339 A.D.), and at that time he mentioned seeing the Shrines of al-Kazim (a.s.) and of his grandson, Taqi (a.s.), the seventh and ninth Imams. He observed that Kazmayn was a suburb by itself, about six thousand paces in circumference.
About that time the Mongol tribe of Julayr wrested the power from the Khans-II, and their chief, Shaikh Hasan Buzurg, made his residence in Baghdad in 1340 A.D., as the town best suited for his tribal headquarters.
Fifty odd years later, in connection with his widespread conquests, Timur spent three months in Baghdad. It happened to be in the summer that he besieged and captured the city, and the Persian chronicler in the Zafar Nameh remarks that “the heat was so intense, that as for the fish in the water, the saliva boiled in their mouths and as for the birds in the air, from the fever heat their livers were cooked and they fell senseless.”
The horrors of the taking of the city are described in graphic detail so thoroughly had all avenue of escape been closed that when the wind accelerated the flames that filled the air, there were many people who threw themselves into the water, to escape the fire or sword. It was a time when the slave market was such that an old man of eighty and a child of twelve sold for the same price and the fire of hate waxed to such a heat that the garment of the wealthy merchant and the rags of the sick beggar burned the same way. Individual soldiers in bands of the troops had been each commissioned to get a head, but some who were not content with one head got all they could tie to their belts. It is mentioned, however, that some of the men of learning and rank were granted his protection and shared his bounty, but the general carnage was hideous. When the inhabitants had been thus almost annihilated, their habitations were dealt with. Only the mosques, the schools, and the dormitories were spared. Accordingly, we read that Timur left Baghdad on account of “vile odour of the carcases of the dead.”
Nevertheless, when Timur took his departure, we are told that he ordered that the city should be rebuilt. The shrine at Kazmayn, however, was not restored. After the death of Timur, there was a brief reoccupation of Baghdad by the Julayrs, who were displaced by the “Black Sheep” Turkomans, who held the city from 1411- 1469 A.D.. They in turn were driven out by their rivals, the “White Sheep” Turkomans. It was therefore after a long period of neglect, when the city had been held by successive generations of half savage tribes, that Shah Ismail I, of the Safawi dynasty captured Baghdad in 1508 A.D., and it was in 1519 A.D. that he completed the rebuilding of the Shrine at Kazmayn much as it stands today. With the rise of Shah Ismail there is an interesting and significant story of the revival of Persian Shia Power, which belongs in the history of Ardebil in Azerbaijan rather than in a description of the Shrine of the “Two Kazims” in Baghdad.
We are told that frequently from twenty-five, to thirty thousand pilgrims visit the Shrine in one day. If viewed from a point of vantage, this Shrine with its twin domes of gleaming gold is one of the most beautiful sights in Baghdad; and if studied in its historical associations throughout the last eleven hundred years, it affords a thrilling resume of the changing fortunes of the far-famed city of Arabian Nights.""",

Marco Polo relates the story that when Halaaku Khan entered Baghdad he found to his astonishment a town that was filled with gold and silver, and in his indignation he gave orders that the avaricious Caliph should be “shut up in this same town, without sustenance; and there, in the midst of his wealth, he soon finished a miserable existence.”
This story is based on the narrative of Mirkhond, of Joinville, and of Makakia, the Armenian historian, and as Howarth remarks it has provided “one of those grim episodes which Longfellow delighted to put into verse”:
I said to the Caliph, “Thou art old,
Thou hast no need of so much gold;
Thou should’st not have heaped and hidden it here,
Till the breath of battle was hot and near,
But have sown through the land these useless hoards,
To spring into shining blades of swords,
And keep thine honour sweet and clear.”
Then into his dungeon I locked the drone,
And left him there to feed all alone,
In the honey cells of his golden hive;
Never a prayer, nor a cry, nor a groan,
Was heard from those massive walls of stone,
Nor again was the Caliph seen alive.
One notable fact in this connection is that the life of the Caliph’s vizier in Baghdad was spared. He was Muayid-ud-din Alkamiya who was known to have been favourable to the Shias, and who was also reported to have sent his submission to Halaaku, and had invited him to invade the country. However, this may be, the Caliph was put to death on the 21st February, 1258 A.D.. Wassaf and Novairi say he was rolled up in carpets and, then trodden under by horses so that his blood should not be spilt. This was in accordance with the ‘yasa’ of Jingis Khan, which forbade the shedding of the blood of royal persons.
But the Caliph’s vizier, whose life was spared, “retained his post as vizier, the reward doubtless of his dubious loyalty.” Various prominent Persians, as distinguished from Arabs or Turks were appointed to important positions in the new administration of affairs, and among the first buildings to be rebuilt was the Shrine of the two Imams, at Kazmayn. 
After the fall of the last of the Abbasid Caliph, Baghdad was never rebuilt on its former scale of grandeur. The Khans-II, who were the descendants of Halaaku, held the city for 82 years, not as a capital, however, but merely as the chief town of the province of Iraq. It was near the close of their period of authority that the traveller Mustawfi visited Baghdad (1339 A.D.), and at that time he mentioned seeing the Shrines of al-Kazim (a.s.) and of his grandson, Taqi (a.s.), the seventh and ninth Imams. He observed that Kazmayn was a suburb by itself, about six thousand paces in circumference.
About that time the Mongol tribe of Julayr wrested the power from the Khans-II, and their chief, Shaikh Hasan Buzurg, made his residence in Baghdad in 1340 A.D., as the town best suited for his tribal headquarters.
Fifty odd years later, in connection with his widespread conquests, Timur spent three months in Baghdad. It happened to be in the summer that he besieged and captured the city, and the Persian chronicler in the Zafar Nameh remarks that “the heat was so intense, that as for the fish in the water, the saliva boiled in their mouths and as for the birds in the air, from the fever heat their livers were cooked and they fell senseless.”
The horrors of the taking of the city are described in graphic detail so thoroughly had all avenue of escape been closed that when the wind accelerated the flames that filled the air, there were many people who threw themselves into the water, to escape the fire or sword. It was a time when the slave market was such that an old man of eighty and a child of twelve sold for the same price and the fire of hate waxed to such a heat that the garment of the wealthy merchant and the rags of the sick beggar burned the same way. Individual soldiers in bands of the troops had been each commissioned to get a head, but some who were not content with one head got all they could tie to their belts. It is mentioned, however, that some of the men of learning and rank were granted his protection and shared his bounty, but the general carnage was hideous. When the inhabitants had been thus almost annihilated, their habitations were dealt with. Only the mosques, the schools, and the dormitories were spared. Accordingly, we read that Timur left Baghdad on account of “vile odour of the carcases of the dead.”
Nevertheless, when Timur took his departure, we are told that he ordered that the city should be rebuilt. The shrine at Kazmayn, however, was not restored. After the death of Timur, there was a brief reoccupation of Baghdad by the Julayrs, who were displaced by the “Black Sheep” Turkomans, who held the city from 1411- 1469 A.D.. They in turn were driven out by their rivals, the “White Sheep” Turkomans. It was therefore after a long period of neglect, when the city had been held by successive generations of half savage tribes, that Shah Ismail I, of the Safawi dynasty captured Baghdad in 1508 A.D., and it was in 1519 A.D. that he completed the rebuilding of the Shrine at Kazmayn much as it stands today. With the rise of Shah Ismail there is an interesting and significant story of the revival of Persian Shia Power, which belongs in the history of Ardebil in Azerbaijan rather than in a description of the Shrine of the “Two Kazims” in Baghdad.
We are told that frequently from twenty-five, to thirty thousand pilgrims visit the Shrine in one day. If viewed from a point of vantage, this Shrine with its twin domes of gleaming gold is one of the most beautiful sights in Baghdad; and if studied in its historical associations throughout the last eleven hundred years, it affords a thrilling resume of the changing fortunes of the far-famed city of Arabian Nights.""",

Allah ordered You to convey, safeguarded that which He entrusted
with you, decided as lawful all that which Allah has deemed lawful,
decided as unlawful all that which Allah has deemed unlawful,
carried out the decrees of Allah, recited the Book of Allah, endured
harm for the sake of Allah, and strove in the way of Allah as it ought
to be striven until death came upon you. I also bear witness that you
passed away carrying the same principles on which your immaculate fathers and pure forefathers the successors, guides,leaders, and rightly guided ones passed away. 

You never preferred blindness to true guidance and never slanted from right to wrong. I
also bear witness that you acted sincerely to Allah, to His
Messenger, and to the Commander of the Faithful, fulfilled the trust,
avoided betrayal, performed the prayers, defrayed the poor-rate,
enjoined the right, forbade the evil, and served Allah earnestly and
painstakingly, expecting His reward, until death came upon you. So,
may Allah reward you on behalf of Islam and its people with the
best reward and the most honoring reward. I have come to you, O
son of Allah’s Messenger, visiting you, recognizing your right,
admitting your precedence, knowing about your knowledgeability,
seeking shield with your inviolability, seeking protection with your
grave, resorting to your tomb, seeking your intercession with Allah,
declaring loyalty to your loyalists, incurring the animosity of your
enemies, seeking insight of your standing and true guidance you
are leading to, and having full acquaintance with the straying of
those who dissent from you and the blindness they are following.
Ransoms for you be my father, mother, myself, my family members,
my property, and my sons. O son of Allah’s Messenger, I have come
to you seeking nearness to Allah the All-exalted by visiting you and
seeking your intercession for me with Him; So, (please) intercede for
me with your Lord so that He may forgive my sins, pardon my
offences, overlook my evildoings, erase my wrongdoings, allow me
to enter Paradise, endue me with favors that suit His generosity, and
forgive me, my forefathers, my brothers, my sister, and all believing
men and women in the east and west of the earth, out of His
favoring, magnanimity, and benevolence. 

Then throw yourself on the grave kiss it and put both your cheeks upon it and pray for whatever you like. Then turn towards the head side and recite:

O my master, I repudiate your enemies in the presence of Allah and I seek nearness to Allah through loyalty to you.

Salman is from us, Ahle Bayt (a.s.).

Thus he is connected to the infallible family. Regarding his  superiority the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) says:
سَلْمانُ بَحْرٌ لا يُنْزَفُ وَكَنْزٌ لا يَنْفَدُ سَلْمانُ مِنّا اَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ يُمْنَحُ الْحِكْمَةَ وَيُؤْتَى الْبُرْهانَ 
Ameerul Momineen (a.s.) has referred to him as Luqman, the wise, Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said he was better than Luqman and Imam Baqir (a.s.) included him among the ‘Motawassemeen’, and tradition implies that Salman knew the ‘Isme Aazam’ and was of those with whom Angels converse. Faith has ten grades and he was at the tenth position. He was cognizant of Ilme Ghaib and visions. In the world he had become enriched with gifts of Paradise and was eager for heaven. Allah and the Prophet loved him. Allah revealed on the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) that he should love four people and Salman is one of them. Verses have come in his praise and whenever Jibraeel (a.s.) descended on the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) he used to get the message that Salam be conveyed to Salman, and also the knowledge of the visions, calamities and genealogy. Janabe Salman (r.a.) used to remain with the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.a.) in the loneliness of the nights. The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.a.) and Ameerul Momeneen (a.s.) had taught many things from the hidden treasure of Allah, as no one else was deserving of these and no one had the capacity to bear them. Salman had reached to such a level that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said:
اَدْرَكَ سَلْمانُ الْعِلْمَ الاَْوَّلَ وَالْعِلْمَ الاْخِرَ وَهُوَ بَحْرٌ لا يُنْزَحُ وَهُوَ مِنّا اَهْلَ الْبَيْتِ 

This much is sufficient to encourage the pilgrims for his Ziyarat. He was of the foremost of the companions is proved by the fact that when he passed away, Ali (a.s.) traveled from Medina to Madaayan and performed his last rites with his own hands and offered the funeral prayers along with rows of angels. Then he returned to Medina the same night. What can be said about love and devotion towards Ahle Bayt (a.s.) that it elevated a man to such a level.

Method of the Ziyarat of Janaab-e-Salman (r.a.)

Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) has related four Ziyarats for Janaab-e- Salman (r.a.) in his book “Misbaahuz-Zaaereen”, but here we shall suffice with only the first Ziyarat, that we have quoted in “Hadiyah”. The fourth Ziyarat has been quoted by the Shaykh (r.a.) in Tahzeeb. When you decide to perform his Ziyarat you should stand near the grave facing the Qibla and recite:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلى رَسُولِ اللهِ مُحَمَّدِ بْنِ عَبْدِ اللهِ خاتَمِ النَّبِيَّينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ سَيِّدِ الْوَصِيّينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى الاَْئِمَّةِ الْمَعْصُومينَ الرّاشِدينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلى الْمَلائِكَةِ الْمُقَرّبينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا صاحِبَ رَسُولِ اللهِ الاَْمينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا وَلِيَّ اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا مُودَعَ اَسْرارِ السَّادَةِ الْمَيامينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا بَقِيَّةَ اللهِ مِنَ الْبَرَرَةِ الْماضينَ، اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبا عَبْدِ اللهِ وَ رَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ، اَشْهَدُ أنَّكَ اَطَعْتَ اللهِ كَما اَمَرَكَ، وَاتَّبَعْتَ الرَّسُولَ كَما نَدَبَكَ، وَتَوَلَّيْتَ خَليفَتَهُ كَما اَلْزَمَكَ، وَدَعَوْتَ اِلَى الاِْهْتِمامِ بِذُرِّيَّتِهِ كَما وَقَفَكَ، وَعَلِمْتَ الْحَقَّ يَقيناً وَاعْتَمَدْتَهُ كَما اَمَرَكَ، اَشْهَدُ أنَّكَ بابُ وَصِيِّ الْمُصْطَفى، وَطَريقُ حُجَّةِ اللهِ الْمُرْتَضى، وَاَمينُ اللهِ فيـما اسْتُوْدِعْتَ مِنْ عُلُومِ الاَْصْفِياءِ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ مِنْ اَهْلِ بَيْتِ النَّبِيِّ النُّجَباءِ الُْمخْتارينَ لِنُصْرَةِ الْوَصِيِّ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ صاحِبُ الْعاشِرَةِ وَالْبَراهينِ وَالدَّلائِلِ الْقاهِرَةِ، وَاَقَمْتَ الصَّلاةَ وَآتَيْتَ الزَّكاةَ، وَاَمَرْتَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ، وَنَهَيْتَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ، وَاَدَّيْتَ الاَْمانَةَ وَنَصَحْتَ للهِ وَلِرَسُولِهِ، وَصَبَرْتَ عَلَى الاَْذى في جَنْبِهِ حَتّى أتاكَ الْيَقينُ، لَعَنَ اللهُ مَنْ جَحَدَكَ حَقَّكَ وَحَطَّ مِنْ قَدْرِكَ، لَعَنَ اللهُ مَنْ آذاكَ في مَواليكَ، لَعَنَ اللهُ مَنْ اَعْنَتَكَ في اَهْلِ بَيْتِ نَبِيِّكَ، لَعَنَ اللهُ مَنْ لامَكَ في ساداتِكَ، لَعَنَ اللهُ عَدُوَّ آلِ مُحَمَّد مِنَ الْجِنِّ وَالاِْنْسِ مِنَ الاَْوَّلينَ وَالاْخِرينَ وَضاعَفَ عَلَيْهِمُ الْعَذابَ الاَْليمَ، صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبا عَبْدِاللهِ، صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْكَ يا صاحِبَ رَسُولِ اللهِ، صَلَّى اللهِ عَلَيْهِ وَآلِهِ وَعَلَيْكَ يا مَوْلى اَميرِ الْمُؤْمِنينَ وَصَلَّى اللهِ عَلى رُوحِكَ الطَّيِّبَةِ، وَجَسَدِكَ الطّاهِر وَألْحَقْنا بِمَنِّهِ وَرأفَتِهِ اِذا تَوَفّانا بِكَ وَبِمَحَلِّ السّادَةِ الْمَيامينَ وَجَمَعَنا مَعَهُمْ بِجِوارِهِمْ في جَنّاتِ النَّعيِمِ، صَلَّى اللهِ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبا عَبْدِ اللهِ، وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلى اِخْوانِكَ الشّيعَةِ الْبَرَرَةِ مِنَ السَّلَفِ الْمَيامينَ، وَادْخَلَ الرُّوحَ وَالرِّضْوانَ عَلَى الْخَلَفِ مِنَ الْمُؤْمِنينَ، وَالْحَقْنا وَاَيّاهُمْ بِمَنْ تَوَلاّهُ مِنْ الْعِتْرَةِ الطّاهِرينَ، وَعَلَيْكَ وَعَلَيْهِمُ اَلسَّلامُ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ 

After this recite surah Qadr seven times and recite any of the recommended prayers.

The writer says: When you intend to return from the Ziyarat you stand near the grave of Janaab-e-Salman (r.a.) and recite the following farewell Dua that Sayyid (r.a.) has mentioned at the end of the fourth Ziyarat.

FAREWELL OF JANAABE SALMAN

اَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ يا اَبا عَبْدِ اللهِ، اَنْتَ بابُ اللهِ الْمُؤْتى مِنْهُ وَالْمَأخُوذُ عَنْهُ، اَشْهَدُ اَنَّكَ قُلْتَ حَقّاً وَنَطَقْتَ صِدْقاً، وَدَعَوْتَ اِلى مَوْلايَ وَمَوْلاكَ عَلانِيَةً وَسِرّاً، اَتَيْتُكَ زائِراً وَحاجاتي لَكَ مُسْتَوْدِعاً، وَها اَنَا ذا مُوَدِّعُكَ، اَسْتَوْدِعُكَ ديني وَاَمانَتي وَخَواتيمَ عَمَلي وَجَوامِعَ اَمَلي اِلى مُنْتَهى اَجَلي، وَاَلسَّلامُ عَلَيْكَ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكاتُهُ، وَصَلَّى اللهُ عَلى مُحَمَّد وَآلِهِ الاَْخْيارِ
        
Then supplicate Allah too much and then return.

Aamals after the Ziyarat of Janab-e-Salmaan (r.a.)

The writer says: When a pilgrim completes the Ziyarat of Janab-e- Salmaan (r.a.) he has two more responsibilities remaining:

1. Reciting prayer in ‘Taaq-e-Kasraa’

Recite 2 or more rakats namaz in ‘Taaq-e-Kasraa’ as Ameerul Momeneen (a.s.) had prayed there. It is related from Ammaar Saabaati that Ameerul Momeneen (a.s.) came to Madaayan and halted at Evaan-e-Kasraa. Dalf bin Baheer was also with him and they prayed over there. Then he got up and said to Dalf: Get up. And there was with him a group of the people of Sabt. He looked at the houses of Kasraa and said to Dalf: There was such and such in this house. Dalf says: By Allah! It is really like that as you have told. Thus with this group he visited all the places. Dalf used to say: O my Master and chief! You are knowing these places as if you yourself have placed them here. According to tradition when Ameerul Momeneen (a.s.) was passing through Madaayan and glancing at the ruins a companion recited didactic couplet “The winds are passing through their abandoned houses. As if, for a period, they were with them.” ‘Why did you recite this’, asked Ameerul Momineen (a.s.):
كَمْ تَرَكُوا مِنْ جَنّات وَعُيُون وَزُرُوع وَمَقام كَريم  وَنَعْمَة كانُوا فيها فاكِهينَ كَذلِكَ وَاَوْرَثْناها قَوْماً آخَرينَ  فَما بَكَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ السَّماءُ وَالاَْرْضُ وَما كانُوا مُنْظَرينَ 

Then he (a.s.) said:
اِنَّ هـؤلاءِ كانُوا وارِثينَ، فَاَصْبَحُوا مَوْرُوثينَ لَمْ يَشْكُرُوا النِّعْمَةَ فَسُلِبُوا دُنْياهُمْ بِالْمَعْصِيَةِ، اِيّاكُمْ وَكُفْرَ النِّعَمِ لا تَحُلُّ بِكُمُ النِّقَمُ""",

(a.s.) included him among the ‘Motawassemeen’, and tradition
implies that Salman knew the ‘Isme Aazam’ and was of those with whom Angels converse. 

Faith has ten grades and he was at the tenth position. He was cognizant of Ilme Ghaib and visions. In the world he had become enriched with gifts of Paradise and was eager for heaven. Allah and the Prophet loved him. Allah revealed on the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) that he should love four people and Salman is one of them. Verses have come in his praise and whenever Jibraeel (a.s.) descended on the Prophet (s.a.w.a.) he used to get the message that Salam be conveyed to Salman, and also the knowledge of the visions, calamities and genealogy.Janabe Salman (r.a.) used to remain with the Holy Prophet(s.a.w.a.) in the loneliness of the nights. The Messenger of Allah(s.a.w.a.) and Ameerul Momeneen (a.s.) had taught many things from the hidden treasure of Allah, as no one else was deserving of these and no one had the capacity to bear them. Salman had reached to such a level that Imam Sadiq (a.s.) said: 

Salmaan has reached to the first and the last of knowledge and he is that ocean which does not dry and he is from us Ahle Bait (a.s.). 

This much is sufficient to encourage the pilgrims for his Ziyarat. He was of the foremost of the companions is proved by the fact that when he passed away, Ali (a.s.) traveled from Medina to Madaayan and performed his last rites with his own hands and offered the funeral prayers along with rows of angels. Then he returned to Medina the same night. What can be said about love and devotion towards Ahle Bayt (a.s.) that it elevated a man to such a level. 

Method of the Ziyarat of Janaab-e-Salman (r.a.)

Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) has related four Ziyarats for Janaab-eSalman (r.a.) in his book “Misbaahuz-Zaaereen”, but here we shall suffice with only the first Ziyarat, that we have quoted in “Hadiyah”. The fourth Ziyarat has been quoted by the Shaykh (r.a.)in Tahzeeb. When you decide to perform his Ziyarat you should stand near the grave facing the Qibla and recite

Peace be on the Prophet of God, Muhammad b ‘Abd Allah, the seal of the Prophets. Peace be on the Commander of the Faithful, leader of the successors. Peace be on the infallible, guided Imams. Peace be on the close angels. Peace be on you, O companion of the Prophet of God, the trustworthy one. Peace be on you, O friend of the Commander of the Faithful. Peace be on you, O repository of the secrets of the fortunate leaders. Peace be on you, O one who remains amongst the previous upright ones. 

Peace be on you, O Abu ‘Abd Allah and may the mercy and blessings of Allah be on you. I bear witness that you obeyed Allah as He commanded you to and you followed the Prophet as He asked you to and you followed his successor as he commanded you to. You invited others to give importance to his family as he told you to. You knew the truth with certainty and you relied on it just as he commanded you to. I bear witness that you are the door to the successor of al-Mustafa and the path to the proof of Allah, al-Murtaza. You are the trustworthy one of Allah, bearing knowledge of the chosen ones that was entrusted to you. I bear witness that you are amongst the family of the Prophet, amongst the notable, selected ones helping the successor.

I bear witness that you are one of the intimate companions, possessing overpowering proofs. You undertook the prayers, gave the zakat commanded the good and forbade the evil. You fulfilled the trust and gave sound advice for Allah and His Prophet. You endured the difficulties with patience at his side until death overtook you. May God curse those who denied your rights and demeaned your status. May God curse those who harassed you because of who you followed, may God curse those who brought distress on your family. May God curse those who blamed you in your leadership. May God curse the enemies of the family of Muhammad, amongst the jinns and humans from the beginning to the end.

May He increase His painful punishment on them. May Allah send His greetings on you, O Abu ‘Abd Allah and may He send His felicitations to you. O companion of the Prophet of Allah(s.a.w.a.). Peace be on you. O the mawla of the Commander of the Faithful. May Allah bless your pure soul and purified body and,through His favors and kindness, may He join us with you when we die and grant us the position of the eminent, fortunate ones. May

He gather us with them in their proximity in the blessed abode. May Allah grant you peace, O Abu ‘Abd Allah and may He send His blessings on your upright Shi’a brethren, the past fortunate ones and may He cause peace and contentment to enter in the past believers. May He cause them and us to join one who exercises authority from the pure family. May Allah send peace and blessings on you and them

After this recite surah Qadr seven times and recite any of the recommended prayers.

The writer says: When you intend to return from the Ziyarat you stand near the grave of Janaab-e-Salman (r.a.) and recite the following farewell Dua that Sayyid (r.a.) has mentioned at the end of the fourth Ziyarat. 

Farewell of Janabe Salman:

Peace be on you, O Abu ‘Abd Allah. You are the door of Allah through which one can approach Him and attain from Him. I bear witness that you spoke the truth with honesty and invited others to your and my master, publicly and in secrecy. I have come to visit you and I entrust my needs to you as I bid you farewell. I entrust you with my religion, trust and my actions and all my hopes to the end of my fixed term. May Allah send his mercy and blessings on you and on Muhammad and his family.

Then supplicate Allah too much and then return""",

task of representation (of the Prophet), carrying it perfectly, and
undertaking the responsibility of bearing it. He neither slipped in
any problematic action nor did he fail to solve any complexity.
Rather, he relieved all agonies, sealed the loopholes, and fulfilled
the required. O Allah, just as You made him a source of delight for 
Your Prophet, so also (please) raise him to the most elevated
position, give him the most fitting reward that suits him, bless him,
convey our greetings and salutations to him, and give us, on
account of our love for him, from You bounties, favors, amnesty,

of Ali, the guide and well-guided. Allah’s mercy and blessings be
upon you. Peace be upon you, O Allah’s intimate servant and son of
Allah’s intimate servants. Peace be upon you, O Allah’s decisive

Peace be upon you, O father of the Awaited Imam: whose claim is evident for the rational people, whose recognition is fixed in the most certain things, whom is concealed against the eyes of the oppressors, whom is hidden from the regimes of the faithless authorities, and through whom our Lord shall recover Islam over again after it will be effaced and He shall recover the Qur'¡n fresh over again after it will be eradicated. O master, I bear witness that you performed the prayers,defrayed the poor-rate, enjoined the right, forbade the wrong,called to the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation,and worshipped Allah sincerely until death came upon you. I thus beseech Allah in the name of the rank that you enjoy with Him to accept my visit to you, receive my efforts with gratitude, respond to my prayers through you, and include me with the supporters of the truth, its followers, its adherents, its devotees, and its lovers. Peace and Allah’s mercy and blessings be upon you. 

If you are in the holy Shrine you must kiss the shrine and then put your right cheek and then left cheek on the shrine and recite: 

O Allah, (please do) send blessings upon our master Muhammad
and his Household and send blessings upon al-Hasan the son of Ali
who guides to Your religion and calls to Your way, who is the sign of
true guidance, the lantern of true piety, the essence of rationality,
the resource of reason, the raining cloud over mankind, the cloud of
wisdom, the ocean of admonition, the heir of the Imams, the witness
over the (Muslim) community, the sinless, the well-mannered, the
virtuous, the favorable (by Allah), the purified against filth, and the
one whom You have given the knowledge of the (Holy) Book in
inheritance, You have inspired with clear judgment, You have
appointed as the leading sign for those who follow the direction
You have decided, You have decided the obedience to him to be
attached to the obedience to You, and You have imposed the love
for him upon all Your creatures. O Allah, as he always turned to You
with excellent sincerity in Your Oneness, argued and defeated those
who anthropomorphized You, and defended those who faithfully
believed in You; so, O my Lord, (please) pour down on him Your
blessings due to which he joins the rank of those who behave
humbly toward You and due to which he surmounts in Paradise to
the rank of his forefather the Seal of the Prophets. And (please do)
convey to him greetings and compliments from us, grant us from You, on account of our loyalty to him, favor and benevolence and also grant us forgiveness and gratification, for You are most certainly the Lord of enormous favor and huge bliss.

Perform the Namaz-e-Ziyarat, then recite:

O All-eternal Lord! O All-everlasting! O Ever-living! O All-subsisting!
O Reliever of agonies and grief! O Soother of anguishes! O
Appointer of Messengers! O Truthful to what You promise! O Everliving! There is no deity save You. I beg You in the name of Your dear
one Muhammad and in the name of his successor Ali his cousin and
the husband of his daughter, through both of whom You have
sealed Your laws and opened the interpretation and Your
pioneering ordains. So, (please do) send upon both of them
blessings that are witnessed by the ancient and the coming
generations and by which the intimate servants and the righteous
ones are saved. I also beg You in the name of Fatemah the
Luminous, the mother of the well-guided Imams, and the Doyenne
of the women of the worlds, who shall be allowed to intercede for
the adherents of her immaculate descendants. So, (please do) send
upon her blessings that are as endless as ages and as endless as
times. I also beg You in the name of al-Hasan the pleased, the
infallible, and the pure, and in the name of al-Husayn the
oppressed, the pleased, the pious, and the righteous; (they both
are) the masters of the youth of Paradise, the two Imams who are
virtuous, infallible, pious, pure, immaculate, martyred, oppressed,
and slain. So, (please do) send upon them blessings whenever the
sun rises and sets; blessings that are consecutive and successive. I
also beg You in the name of Ali the son of al-Husayn the chief of the
worshippers and the concealed for fear of the oppressors, and in the
name of Muhammad the son of Ali, the splitter of knowledge, the pure, the glowing light. 

(They both are) the two Imams and masters,the keys to blessings, and the lanterns in the murk. So, (please) send blessings upon them whenever night comes and whenever daylight rises; such blessings that are ceaseless. I also beg You in the name of

Ja’far the son of Muhammad, the truthful in what he conveys from
Allah and the spokesman of Allah’s knowledge and in the name of
Musa the son of Ja’far, the self-righteous servant (of Allah) and the
well-whishing successor (of the Prophet); (they both are) the two
guiding and well-guided Imams and the two adequate and saving
Imams. So, (please) send upon them blessings whenever an angel
glorifies You and whenever a planet moves; such blessings that are
increasable and growing and neither ending nor stopping. I also
beg You in the name of Ali the son of Musa the well-pleased and in
the name of Muhammad the son of Ali the well-contented; the two
purified and divinely selected Imams. So, (please) send upon them
blessings whenever morning glows and endures with such blessings
that take them up to the rank of Your pleasure in the highest level of
the gardens of Your Paradise. I also beg You in the name of Ali the
son of Muhammad the rightly-directing and in the name of al-Hasan
the son of Ali the guide; the two Imams who supervise the affairs of
Your servants, whom are tested by unbearable ordeals, and who
acted patiently against the swerving enmities. So, (please do) send
upon them blessings that are suitable to the reward of the enduring
people and worth being the prize of the winners; such blessings that
pave for them the way to exaltation. I also beg You, O Lord, in the
name of our Imam the rising in our ages, the promised day, the
witnessed observer, the luminous light, the bright illumination, the
supported by means of horror, and the triumphant with happiness.

So, (please) send upon him blessings that are as many as the numbers of fruits, the leaves of trees, the townspeople, the hairs of people and animals, and all things that Your knowledge encompasses and You Book counts; such blessings due to which all the ancient and the last generations wish to have their like. O Allah,(please do) include us with his group, make us keep on obeying him,guard us through his state, confer upon us with the loyalty to him,give us victory over our enemies as a result of his power, and 

include us, O Lord, with those who turn to You constantly. O most
merciful of all those who show mercy! O Allah, Ibl¢s the rebel and
accursed asked You to grant him respite so that he would mislead
Your creatures; and You granted him so. He asked You to reprieve
him so that he would misguide Your servants, and You reprieved
him. This is because You had already known about him. He thus
nested and gave birth to many hosts. So, his armies have been
overcrowding, his propagandists have widespread in all the corners
of this earth, they have mislead Your servants, deformed Your
religion, displaced the words from their right places, and made Your
servants diverse revelries and rebellious parties. You promised that
You would demolish his (i.e. Ibl¢s) edifice and tear out his matters.
So, (please do) deaden his sons and armies, purify Your lands from
his inventions and fabrications, relieve Your servants from his
factions and analogies, make the disaster of evil surround them,
extend Your justice, give victory to Your religion, give strength to
Your intimate servants, weaken Your enemies, make Your intimate
servants inherit the lands of Iblis and these of his fans, make the
fans of Iblis stay forever in the blazing Fire, make them taste the painful torment, and make the curses of You that are kept in the evil part of the creation and in the deformed part of the nature surround them forever, control over them, and strike them every morning and evening and every moment of coming and going. O Our Lord,(please do) grant us goodness in this world and goodness in the world to come and save us, out of Your mercy, from the torment of Fire. O most merciful of all those who show mercy.""",

This was before the construction of the dome and shrine etc. The entry to it was from the ‘Uqbaa’ that is near the grave of Janab-e- Narjis (s.a.). May be it is in the patio. There it goes down and in it was a long dark verandah, passing through it, one reached the gate of the ‘Sardaab’ of ‘Ghaibat’. Now it has been mirrored. And from the side of the Qibla in the courtyard of the two Askaris a window used to open, where now a wall of glazed tiles is made in the shape of a ‘Mehraab’. In brief, the Aamal of all three Imams (a.s.) were performed in the same shrine.That is the reason that the first martyr has mentioned the Ziyarat of Sardaab after the Ziyarat of two Askaris, and after that he has mentioned the Ziyarat of Janab-e-Narjis (s.a.). And approximately 100 years before Ahmad Khan Dambali spent a lot of money and separated the courtyards of the two Imams (a.s.) as they are to the present day, and he constructed therein the shrine, the patio and a high dome. The courtyard and hall of the holy Sardaab was made separate, as also separate staircase and Sardaab was built for ladies as it is presently. The first entrance to the Sardaab and the old staircase is now closed. Now, there is not even a sign of it. No place remains where we can perform the rituals of entering the Sardaab, but the place of the Ziyarat in the Sardaab is not changed. However, the permission can be sought at the entry point generally used now. One cannot enter any shrine without reciting this permission. Now we shall describe the method of Ziyarat. It should be clear that the permission for entry into the cellar is the Dua we have mentioned before. It begins with the words:
اَللّـهُمَّ اِنَّ هـذِهِ بُقْعَةٌ طَهَّرْتَها وَعَقْوَةٌ شَرَّفْتَه

at the end permission is asked and it is recited at the entry to the Sardab at the head of the stairs that go below. Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) has mentioned one Dua for permission and it is almost the same we have mentioned in the 2nd part of the chapter of Ziyarat and the permission dua which Allamah Majlisi (r.a.) has narrated begins with the following words:
We have mentioned it after the common permission Dua and it can be referred there. So, recite the permission Dua and enter the Sardaab and perform the Ziyarat based on Imam (a.s.)’s directions. The great scholar, Ahmad bin abi Talib Tabarsi (r.a.) has mentioned a tradition in ‘Ihtejaaj’ that the following reply came from Imam (a.s.) to the question of Mohammad Humairi:

Now we shall describe the method of Ziyarat. It should be clear that the permission for entry into the cellar is the Dua we have mentioned before. It begins with the words: ASSALAMO ALAYKA YA KHALIFATALLAH

at the end permission is asked and it is recited at the entry to the Sardab at the head of the stairs that go below. Sayyid Ibne Taaoos (r.a.) has mentioned one Dua for permission and it is almost the same we have mentioned in the 2nd part of the chapter of Ziyarat and the permission dua which Allamah Majlisi (r.a.) has narrated begins with the following words: 


We have mentioned it after the common permission Dua and it can be referred there. So, recite the permission Dua and enter the Sardaab and perform the Ziyarat based on Imam (a.s.)’s directions.The great scholar, Ahmad bin abi Talib Tabarsi (r.a.) has mentioned a tradition in ‘Ihtejaaj’ that the following reply came from Imam (a.s.) to the question of Mohammad Humairi: 

In the Name of Allah; the All-beneficent, the All-merciful. You neither understand His decree nor accept from His Vicegerents.(This is) consummate wisdom; but warnings do not avail people who do not believe. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of Allah""",

Then go to the cellar of occultation and stand between the door holding both the doors with your hands and clear your throat as if you are entering a house as if seeking permission to enter someone’s house. And recite BISMILLAAHIR RAHMAANIR RAHEEM and go down with peace and presence of mind and recite two rakats prayers in the cellar and then recite the following:

After the Dua enter the ‘Safah’ and pray 2 rakats Namaz and then recite the following dua:
اَللّـهُمَّ عَبْدُكَ الزّائِرُ في فِناءِ وَلِيِّكَ الْمَزُورِ الَّذي فَرَضْتَ طـاعَتَهُ عَلَى الْعَبيدِ وَالاَْحْرارِ، وَاَنْقَذْتَ بِهِ اَوْلِياءَكَ مِنْ عَذابِ النّارِ، اَللّـهُمَّ اجْعَلْها زِيارَةً مَقْبُولَةً ذاتَ دُعآء مُسْتَجاب مِنْ مُصَدِّق بِوَلِيِّكَ غَيْرِمُرْتاب،اَللّـهُمَّ لا تَجْعَلْهُ آخِرَ الْعَهْدِ بِهِ وَلا بِزِيارَتِهِ، وَلا تَقْطَعْ اَثَري مِنْ مَشْهَدِهِ وَزِيارَةِ اَبيهِ وَجَدِّهِ، اَللّـهُمَّ اَخْلِفْ عَلَيَّ نَفَقَتي وَانْفَعْني بِما رَزَقْتَني في دُنْيايَ وَآخِرَتي لي ولاِِخْواني وَاَبَوَيَّ وَجَميعِ عِتْرَتي، اَسْتَودِعُكَ اللهَ اَيُّهَا الاِْمامُ الَّذي يَفُوزُ بِهِ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ، وَيَهْلِكُ عَلى يَدَيْهِ الْكافِرُونَ الْمُكَذِّبُونَ، يا مَوْلايَ يَا بْنَ الْحَسَنِ بْنِ عَلِيٍّ جِئْتُكَ زآئِراً لَكَ وَلاَِبيكَ وَجَدِّكَ، مُتَيَقِّناً الْفَوْزَ بِكُمْ، مُعْتَقِداً اِمامَتَكُمْ، اَللّـهُمَّ اَكْتُبْ هذِهِ الشَّهادَةَ وَالزِّيارَةَ لي عِنْدَكَ في عِلّيّينَ، وَبَلِّغْني بَلاغَ الصّالِحينَ، وَانْفَعْني بِحُبِّهِمْ يا رَبَّ الْعالَمينَ""",

Another Ziyarat is narrated in reliable books of the scholars that is to be recited at the entrance to the Sardaab:

Peace be upon you, O vicegerent of Allah and vicegerent of your
well-guided fathers. Peace be upon you, O successor of the past
successors (of the Prophets). Peace be upon you, O keeper of the
secrets of the Lord of the worlds. Peace be upon you, O Allah’s
remainder from among the elite, select ones. Peace be upon you, O
son of the luminous lights. Peace be upon you, O son of the splendid
signs. Peace be upon you, O son of the immaculate progeny. Peace
be upon you, O essence of the Prophetic knowledge. Peace be upon
you, O Allah’s gate; the only gate from which one can enter to Him.
Peace be upon you, O Allah’s course that perdition will be the result
of anyone who takes other than it. Peace be upon you, O observer of
the Tree of Bliss (§£b¡) and the Farthest Lot-tree. Peace be upon you,O Allah’s light that never extinguishes. 

Peace be upon you, O Allah’s decisive argument that is never hidden. Peace be upon you, O
Allah’s decisive argument against all those on the earth and in the
heavens. Peace be upon you; a salutation of one who recognizes you as exactly as Allah has introduced you and one who mentions only
some of your characteristics that you are worthy of and even more. I
bear witness that you are the argument against the past and the
coming generations, your party are the true triumphant, your
friends are the true winners, your enemies are truly losers, you are
the keeper of the entire knowledge, you are the opener of all closed
things, you are the establisher of all truths, and you are the
eradicator of all wrong things. O my master, I accept you as my
leader, guide, master, and adviser. I never seek any alternative and I
never betake myself any master save You. I bear witness that you
are verily the unchanging truth that is free of any defect and that
Allah’s promise concerning you is so true that I never doubt no
matter how long the occultation will take and the time (of your
advent) will be far and I will never have misgivings like those who
ignore you and ignore the truth that you represent and I am waiting
and expecting your age, for you are the unmatched intercessor and
the irrefutable master. Allah has saved you for the support of the
religion, for the fortification of the believers, and for retaliating
upon the deniers and the apostates. I bear witness that through the
loyalty to you, deeds are approved, acts are purified, rewards are
doubled, and punishments for wrongdoings are erased. Therefore,
he who bears loyalty to you and recognizes your Imamate will have
his deeds approved, his sayings credited, his rewards doubled, and
his wrongdoings erased; while if he rejects loyalty to you, ignores
the recognition of you, and follows anyone else, Allah shall throw
him down in Hellfire on the nose, shall never approve of any of his
acts, and shall never set up a balance for him on the Day of Resurrection. 

I ask Allah and His angels and you, my master, to testify to this for me; the outward of this declaration is as same as its inward, and its secret is as same as its overtness; and you are the witness on this declaration, and this is my pledge with you and my

covenant to you since you are verily the system of the religion, the
leader of the pious ones, and the dignity of the monotheists. This is
the command of the Lord of the Worlds to me. Even if times take
longer periods and ages extend, this will increase in me nothing but
more belief in you, love for you, reliance on and trust in you,
anticipation and expectation of your advent, and waiting to strive
hard in your presence. So, I sacrifice myself, my fortune, my sons,
my family members, and all that which my Lord has granted me for
your sake and for obeying your orders and refraining from that
which you order me not to do. O my master, If I catch your thriving
days and see your splendid signs, then, here I, a servant of you, am
yielding to your orders and abstaining from that which you order
me not to do. Through all that, I hope for martyrdom in your
presence and success in your view. O my master, but if death comes
upon me before your advent, then I beseech you and your
immaculate fathers to mediate for me before Allah the All-exalted
Whom I pray to send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household
of Muhammad and to decide for me a return after your advent and a
second life during your days so that I will attain obedience to you,
which is my desire, and to heal my heart from your enemies. O my
master, while I am visiting you, I am standing in the position of the repentant wrongdoers, who fear the chastisement of the Lord of the Worlds and I am, meanwhile, depending upon your intercession for me and I, through my loyalty to you and your intercession for me,wish for eradication of my sins, covering of my defects, and forgiveness of my slips. So, O my master, (please) help me – your servant – to achieve my hope and (please) ask Allah to forgive my slips. Verily, I am clinging to your rope, holding on my loyalty to you, and declaring my disavowal of your enemies. O Allah, (please)bless Muhammad and his Household and fulfill Your promise to Your Vicegerent. O Allah, (please) make prevalent his word, elevate his mission, and support him against Your and his enemies, O Lord
of the Worlds! O Allah, (please) send blessings upon Muhammad
and the Household of Muhammad and allow Your Perfect Word,
Your concealed one in Your lands, the afraid, and the vigilant, to
reappear. O Allah, (please) support him with powerful support and
give him a nigh victory. O Allah, (please) fortify the religion through him after it has been sluggish, demonstrate the truth through him after it has declined, remove darkness through him, and relieve the grief through him. O Allah, (please) spread security over the lands through him and guide the servants (of You) through him. O Allah, (please) fill the earth with justice and equality through him as it is filled with injustice and wrong. Verily, You are All-hearing and Responding. Peace be upon you, O Allah’s vicegerent. (please) permit me, your servant, to enter your sanctuary. May Allah’s blessings be upon you and upon your immaculate fathers. Allah’s mercy and benedictions be upon you.

Then go to the cellar of occultation and stand between the door holding both the doors with your hands and clear your throat as if you are entering a house as if seeking permission to enter someone’s house. And recite BISMILLAAHIR RAHMAANIR RAHEEM and go down with peace and presence of mind and recite two rakats prayers in the cellar and then recite the following:

Allah is the Most Great. Allah is the Most Great. Allah is the Most
Great. There is no god save Allah. Allah is the Most Great and to
Allah be all praise. All praise be to Allah Who has guided us to this,
made us discriminate between His friends and enemies, granted us
success to visit our Imams, and has not made us of the obdurate
antagonists (of the truth), nor of the immoderate indeterminists,
nor of the suspicious and negligent. Peace be upon Allah’s
vicegerent and son of His vicegerents. Peace be upon the one saved
for achieving dignity of Allah’s intimate servants and for ruining
Allah’s enemies. Peace be upon the light that the people of atheism
intend to extinguish; but Allah would not allow but that His light
should be perfected, despite their contempt. He thus supported him
with survival so that He shall make prevalent the truth at his hands
against their will. I bear witness that Allah has chosen you since you were little and perfected His knowledge for you when you grew up; and that you are alive and you will not die before you efface all idols and false deities. O Allah, (please) bless him and his servants and those who helped him to occult and hide from sights, cover him with invulnerable covering, arrange for him an invincible haven, 

ncrease, O Allah, Your intensity on those who resist him obdurately,
and guard his loyalists and visitors. O Allah, just as You have made
my heart full of reference to him, so also (please) make my weapon
prepared in support of him. If death that You have made
inescapable on Your servants and You have made inevitably
predestined on Your creatures impedes me from meeting him, then
(please) restore me to life at his advent, coming out from my hole
(i.e. grave), and using my shroud as my garment so that I will fight
strivingly in his presence in the line whose people have been
praised by You in You Book where You say, “…as if they were a firm
and compact wall.” O Allah, too long has been the expectation, the
wicked are gloating at our misfortune, and victory has been difficult
for us. O Allah, (please) show us the blessed face of Your vicegerent
in our lifetimes and after death. O Allah, I profess of the Return as
my faith in the presence of the owner of this area. [I beseech for]
Relief, relief, relief. O Patron of the Age! I have ruptured my
relations with many friends in order to build good relations with
you, I have deserted my homeland in order to visit you, and I have
concealed my intention from the peoples of the towns so that you
may be my intercessor with your and my Lord and with your fathers
and my masters, seeking excellence of success, conferral of
bounties, and making charitable acts run towards me. O Allah,
(please) send blessings upon Muhammad and the Household of Muhammad the rightful ones and the leaders of the creatures, and (please) respond to me in what I have besought You for and grant me all that which I have not mentioned in my prayer, such as the uprightness of my faith and my worldly affairs. You are verily worthy of praise and worthy of glory. May Allah bless Muhammad and his Immaculate Household. 

After the Dua enter the ‘Safah’ and pray 2 rakats Namaz and then recite the following dua:

O Allah, I – Your visiting servant – am in the yard of Your visited vicegerent the obedience to whom has been made obligatory by You on the slaves and the free and through whom You shall save Your intimate servants from the chastisement of Hellfire. O Allah,(please) decide it to be an admitted visitation of a granted prayer from one who gives full credence to Your vicegerent and who never suspects him. O Allah, (please) do not decide this to be the last of my presence and visitation to him and do not cut off my traces in his shrine and in visitation to his father and grandfather. 

O Allah,(please) compensate for me my expenditure, make me benefit from the sustenance that You have provided me in my worldly life and in my Next Life, and do the same to my brothers, parents, and all of my offspring. I entrust you with Allah, O Leader through whom the believers will win and at whose hands the belying unbelievers will perish. O my master! O son of al-Hasan the son of Ali, I have come to you visiting you, your father, and your grandfather, being certain of winning through you, and having full faith in your Imamate. O Allah,(please) write down this testimony and visitation to me with You in the Most Elevated Place, make me attain that which is attained by the righteous ones, and make me benefit by my love for them, O Lord of the Worlds.""",

After this perform the Namaz-e-Ziyarat in the way described before. Recite 12 rakats in units of 2 each, then recite the Tasbeeh of Faatemah Zahra (s.a.) and gift it’s reward to the Hazrat (a.s.). After the Namaz-e-Ziyarat recite the following:

The writer says: After the first Ziyarat, which begins with
اَللهُ اَكْبَرُ لا اِلـهَ اِلاَّ اللهُ وَاللهُ اَكْبَرُ 

Shaykh Mufid has written according to another tradition it is mentioned that at the time of entering the cellar you must say:
اَلسَّلامُ عَلَى الْحَقِّ الْجَديدِ 

After that he has mentioned the whole Ziyarat with the Namaz and then said: After this recite twelve rakats prayer in units of two rakats each and then recite the Dua narrated from the Imam (a.s.):
اِللهمَّ عَظُمَ الْبَلاءُ، وَبَرِحَ الْخَفاءُ، وَانْكَشَفَ الْغِطاءُ، وَضاقَتِ الاَْرْضُ وَمُنِعَتِ السَّماءُ وَاِلَيْكَ يا ربّ الْمُشْتَكى وَعَلَيْكَ الْمُعَوَّلُ فِى الشِّدَّةِ وَالرَّخاءِ اَللّـهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلى مُحَمَّدٍ وَ آله الَّذينَ فَرَضْتَ عَلَيْنا طاعَتَهُمْ َفعَرَّفْتَنا بِذلِكَ مَنْزِلَتَهُمْ فَرِّجْ عَنّا بِحَقِّهِمْ فَرَجاً عاجِلاً كَلَمْحِ الْبَصَرِ اَوْ هُوَ اَقْرَبُ مِنْ ذلكَ يا مُحَمَّدُ يا عَلِيُّ، يا عَلِيُّ يا مُحَمَّدُ َانْصُراني فَاِنَّكُما ناصِرايِ وَاَكْفياني فَاَنَّكُما كافِياي يا مَوْلاي يا صاحِبَ الزَّمانِ الْغَوْثَ الْغَوْثَ الْغَوْثَ، اَدْرِكْني اَدْرِكْني اَدْرِكْني 

The writer says: It is the best Dua and it should again be recited there at another place and we have mentioned this dua in the first chapter with a slight difference.

Dua for the Saahebul Amr (a.t.f.s.) 

Yunus bin Abdul Rahman has related that Imam Reza (a.s.) has commanded us to pray for Saahebul Amr (a.t.f.s.) and the Dua is as follows:

those who were sacrificed from the descendants of Ismail! Peace be
on both of you, O those who continue to live, nurtured by Allah, the
Majestic! I bear witness, that you sacrificed to help Allah and to obey
His Prophet in the way that sacrifice is to be made, May Allah give
reward to you both from Himself and His Prophet and his Ahlul Bait
and Islam and from Muslim - such a reward that is reserved for
Shahids (Martyrs). May He also give rewards reserved for those who
do good and elevated positions reserved for the pious. 

May He also gather both of you and us via your medium and those of your ancestors who are Prophets and martyrs and performers of good deeds and good followers. May Allah not abandon us from this good fortune and recommendation Ameen! Peace be from all the worlds on both of you! Allah's blessings and bounties on you!""",
