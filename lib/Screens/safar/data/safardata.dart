بِسْمِ اللّٰهِ وَ بِاللّٰهِ وَ اِلَى اللّٰهِ وَ اِلَى ابْنِ رَسُوْلِ اللّٰهِ حَسْبِيَ اللّٰهُ تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللّٰهِ اَللّٰهُمَّ اِلَيْكَ تَوَجَّهْتُ وَ اِلَيْكَ قَصَدْتُ وَ مَا عِنْدَكَ اَرَدْتُ

It is a matter of great fortune for a person if he gets the opportunity for the Ziarat of Imam Ali Reza (a.s.). One should pray with all sincerity that one is bestowed this honour again and again. Although people are unaware of its greatness and merits and consider it sufficient to perform this Ziarat once only.The Messenger of Allah (s.a.w.s.) said, "A part of my body would be buried in Khorasan. Allah would ensure Paradise for the believer who visits it and make hell prohibited for him. If a grief-stricken person does the Ziarat, Allah would dispel his grief. If a sinner does the Ziarat, Allah would forgive his SINS.

Imam Musa Kazim (a.s.w.s) said,
"The reward of the Ziarat of Imam Reza (a.s.) is equivalent to 70 Hajjs accepted by Allah."In some other traditions its reward is mentioned to be equivalent to 1000 Hajjs and Umrahs.This Ziarat would be useful at three important points in the Qiyamat. 

1.When the scrolls of deeds would be handed over to their owners, the scrolls of good people would be given in their right hands and those 
of the sinners in their left. 

2.On the Sirat Bridge (Pul-e-Sirat) 

3. On the balance of deeds (Meezan).Where the deeds would be weighed. 

It should be clear that there are many Ziarats for Imam Ali Reza (a.s.). His famous Ziarat is only that which is found in authentic books and it is related to shaykh Muhammad bin Hasan bin waleed. He was a teacher of Shaykh Sadooq. From ibne Quluwahy's book Al-Mazar it is known that this Ziarat is also related by the Holy Imams (a.s.). 

According to the book Manla Yazarul Faqih the Ziarat is as follows: 

When you decide to go for the Ziarat of Imam Ali Reza (a.s.), before you begin your journey from home, perform Ghusl and while doing to recite the following:

اَللّٰهُمَّ طَهِّرْنِيْ وَ طَهِّرْ لِيْ قَلْبِيْ وَ اشْرَحْ لِيْ صَدْرِيْ وَ اَجْرِ عَلٰى لِسَانِيْ مِدْحَتَكَ وَ الثَّنَاۤءَ عَلَيْكَ فَاِنَّهُ لَا قُوَّةَ اِلَّا بِكَ اَللّٰهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ لِيْ طَهُوْرًا وَ شِفَاۤءً

when you reach Mash'hade Muqaddas first perform Ghusl and recite this dua:""",

It is located at the altitude of 985 Meter occupying an area of 204 sq. Km. and has a population of about 1.5 million.Mashad grew from a small village called Sanabad, 24 km away from Tus. After the martyrdom of Imam Ali ibn Musa Al-Reza and his burial there in 203 AH, the place came to be known as Mashad Al-Reza. Astan-e-Qods-Razavi (the name given to the physical buildings comprising the Haram) is one of the most beautiful and glorious religious places in Iran. The best of Islamic art and architecture can be seen in the unique and significant monuments where Islamic art and faith is embedded made a big garden between Noughan and Sanadan and erected a palace which stood up to the beginning of the 4th century AH. Haroon, who had come to Tus to suppress the Khorasan rebellion, became ill and resided in the garden during his ailment. But he died in 193 H. And was buried inside the palace. Upon his tomb a shrine was built. 
In 203 AH, Imam Al-Reza, peace be upon him, was poisoned by Mamoun, the son of Haroon and Imam was buried alongside with Haroon. Since the martyrdom of Imam, his holy shrine became a place of pilgrimage for the world's Shias and the city spread so far as Noughan and Sanabad were annexed.""",
